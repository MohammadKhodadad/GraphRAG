        3. **Factual Relations** Only extract factual relations. Avoid observations, opinions, and findings.
        4. **Tuple Format:** Output extracted facts in the form of **(entity1, relation, entity2)**.
        5. **Avoid Generic Relations:** Exclude weak relations like "is," "are," "exists," "relates to." Focus on **specific interactions**.

        1. **Entity Matching:** Extract descriptions **only** for the entities listed in the provided set. Ignore any entity that is not explicitly mentioned in the set.
        2. **Concise & Relevant Descriptions:** Each description should be **factual, chemically relevant, and no longer than a sentence or two**. Avoid unnecessary explanations.
        3. **Meaningful Chemical Properties:** Focus on essential chemical **properties, behaviors, or roles** (e.g., acidity, solubility, reactivity, catalytic function).
        3. **Factual Descriptions** Only extract factual descriptions. Avoid observations, opinions, and findings.
        5. **Tuple Format:** Output extracted facts as a Python list of tuples in the form of **(entity, description)**.
        6. **Avoid General/Vague Information:** Descriptions should be precise and **chemically informative** rather than generic (e.g., "is a compound" is too weak).
        7. **Only Output from the Given Text:** Descriptions have to come from the text. If there is no description for an entity, don't output anything for that entity.

In Suzuki coupling reactions, Cs‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ acts as a catalyst by facilitating the deprotonation of boronic acids. However, its efficiency is questionable, as many researchers prefer stronger bases like potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK).

# Additionally, Cs‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ precipitates at concentrations above 8 M, limiting its application in high-concentration reactions. While some scientists believe it is an inferior catalyst compared to organic bases, others argue that its solubility advantages outweigh its lower catalytic efficiency.

# Moreover, Cs‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ is a better choice than K‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ in reactions that require higher solubility in polar solvents. However, in my experience, reactions catalyzed by Cs‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ take much longer to complete, making it an impractical choice for time-sensitive experiments.

# Interestingly, a recent study found that Cs‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ accelerates some esterification reactions in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), but its role as a catalyst in these systems is still debated. Some researchers claim that Cs‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ plays no direct role and that the solvent itself may be responsible for the acceleration."""
