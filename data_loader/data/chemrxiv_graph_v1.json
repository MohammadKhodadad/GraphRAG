Key to the strategy is an outer\nsphere C(sp3)C(sp3) bond formation capable of forming \nquaternary centers.

In general, these highly \nchemoselective conditions tolerate a range of functional groups including carbamates amides, \nalkyl halides, epoxides, aryl halides, esters, alcohols, nitriles, tertiary amines, ketones, ureas, and \nelectronrichdeficient heterocycles. It is particularly noteworthy that alkyl bromides, terminal \nalkynes as well as an alkyl boronate, remain intact during this quartenization despite their notorious \nreactivity in both transitionmetal catalyzed couplings and radical chemistry. Similarly, aryl \niodides and electrondeficient aryl chlorides are left untouched despite their common use in radical \ncross couplings."

A strategy that combines the diversity of a general PBM reaction with alkyl boronic coupling \npartners exponentially increases the accessibility of C(sp3)rich alkyl amines (Figure 1C, mnp \nhypothetical products in a 3D library).

Results and discussion \nBackground. In our daily practice, we often use two standard \napproaches to methyl sulfones described above (Figure 1). Recently, we received a request from a pharmaceutical \ncompany for a synthesis of pyrazole 2 (Scheme 1), which was \ndescribed in a patent before.12 In that method, bromide 3 was \ntreated first with nBuLi followed by the addition of (MeS)2."

The developed method to MeSO2derivatives was not without \nlimitations, however. It worked well only for the electronrich \nsystems. Not sufficiently activated parabromo and para\nmethoxy anilines gave only the side products 55 and 56, \ncorrespondingly. From reagent 1 we also could not obtain \nproducts 5760 as formation of a complex mixtures was \nobserved in each case (Scheme 3; see also SI p. S39S40). Modifications."

Results and discussion \nBackground. In our daily practice, we often use two standard \napproaches to methyl sulfones described above (Figure 1). Recently, we received a request from a pharmaceutical \ncompany for a synthesis of pyrazole 2 (Scheme 1), which was \ndescribed in a patent before.12 In that method, bromide 3 was \ntreated first with nBuLi followed by the addition of (MeS)2."

In fact, the presence of a quaternary center even \nin seemingly trivial structures can dominate the practitioners entire retrosynthetic plan (referred \nto by Corey as a keying element). Here we report a simple catalyst and minimal reagents that \nconvert two types of feedstock chemicalscarboxylic acids and olefinsinto tetrasubstituted \ncarbons via quaternization of radical intermediates.

The deployment of \nTDOs in targetoriented synthesis remains surprisingly rare20,21, but encouraged by our recent study22 \nin the context of the illudalane sesquiterpenes, we contemplated their application in the construction \nof the Strychnos alkaloids. Deviating from previous examples where TDOs have been used in the de \nnovo construction of polysubstituted benzenes2024, we questioned whether these underexploited \ndienes could also be used to assemble the nonaromatic carbocyclic Strychnos core."

This is largely a \nconsequence of relying exclusively on conventional polarbond based retrosynthetic \ndisconnections that in turn require multiple functional group interconversions, redox \nmanipulations, and protecting group chemistry. In fact, the presence of a quaternary center even \nin seemingly trivial structures can dominate the practitioners entire retrosynthetic plan (referred \nto by Corey as a keying element). Here we report a simple catalyst and minimal reagents that \nconvert two types of feedstock chemicalscarboxylic acids and olefinsinto tetrasubstituted \ncarbons via quaternization of radical intermediates. An iron porphyrin catalyst activates each \nsubstrate by electron transfer or hydrogen atom transfer then combines the fragments by an SH2 \nreaction."

However, their application in synthetic organic chemistry is \nexceedingly rare due to the challenging CH bond cleavage, which typically demands high \ntemperatures and pressures, thereby limiting their utility in the construction of complex organic \nmolecules. In particular, the formation of C(sp2)C(sp3) bonds is crucial for constructing \nbiologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals."

In the case of 63, the \ntertiary alcohol served as a radical precursor en route to alkylation \nwith dehydroalanine33 to yield complex scaffold, 64. Conclusion \nHerein, we describe a general procedure for the undirected \ndialkylation of unactivated alkenes. Key to the strategy is an outer\nsphere C(sp3)C(sp3) bond formation capable of forming \nquaternary centers.

Burleyb \na GSK, Gunnels Wood Road, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, SG1 2NY, United Kingdom \nb Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, G1 1XL, United Kingdom \nABSTRACT \nProteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a family of heterobifunctional molecules that are now \nrealising their promise as a therapeutic strategy for targeted protein degradation. However, one \nlimitation of existing designs is the lack of cellselective targeting of the protein degrading payload.

For this reaction, dtbbpy was employed in concert \nwith Ni(dme)Cl2 along with Et3N (3.0 equiv.) to furnish five representative adducts in 3565 \nyield (37). Interestingly, the yield of this reaction was significantly reduced in the absence of a \nNiL system.

Stabilized radicals can also be coupled (heteroatom, benzylic) derived from aheteroatom \ncontaining acids. In the case of RAERAE couplings of such substrates, FeOEP led to a \ndramatically increased yield. Complex pharmaceutically relevant structures can be coupled \nefficiently resulting in quaternary center containing analogs 3640. The direct installation of all\ncarbon quaternary centers within saturated heterocycles is a particularly challenging motif to \nconstruct by conventional polar bond analysis; this quaternization allows an intuitive coupling \nfrom readily accessible heterocyclic fragments (10, 11, 12, 15, 16)."

A simpler means to achieve radical cross\ncoupling without the use of exogenous redox methods would be highly attractive based on first \nprinciples reasoning as it would reduce cost and the complexity of reaction setup. Alkyl diazenes \nare a prime candidate for radical precursors that could achieve such an objective (14, 15). These \nspecies have been invoked since the late 1930s (16, 17) yet their use in organic synthesis has been \nsporadic and mainly relegated to 2edefunctionalization methods such as the classic Wolff\nKishner reduction and related reactions (1721) (Figure 1B, left)."

A discussion of their optimization \ncan be found in the Supplementary Materials and a detailed mechanistic study for each will be \nforthcoming. The simplest of radical couplings, namely Giesetype additions to unsaturated \nspecies was demonstrated first (Table 1A, top). For this reaction, dtbbpy was employed in concert \nwith Ni(dme)Cl2 along with Et3N (3.0 equiv.) to furnish five representative adducts in 3565 \nyield (37). Interestingly, the yield of this reaction was significantly reduced in the absence of a \nNiL system. Next, the direct formation of C(sp3)C(sp3) linkages was explored using both alkyl \nhalides and alkyl redoxactive esters (RAEs) as coupling partners (Table 1A, bottom) (2325)."

In the case of RAERAE coupling, the use of Zn metal is \nwellprecedented to reductively decompose NHPI esters into carbon centered radicals. The different optimal bases in conditions AB were determined empirically and likely \nfulfill different roles silanes can require Lewis base addition to increase hydridic strength19 andor \naccelerate metal hydride formation20 en route to MHAT with alkenes.

As most reactions of this class \nare mediated by a 2e mechanism where alkyl migration is unlikely to happen20, extending this \nreactivity to unactivated alkyl boronates, to escaping from the flatland 3, has been a challenge. A strategy that combines the diversity of a general PBM reaction with alkyl boronic coupling \npartners exponentially increases the accessibility of C(sp3)rich alkyl amines (Figure 1C, mnp \nhypothetical products in a 3D library).

On investigating the oxidative potentials \nof various alkylboron atecomplex species (Figure 1E)23, catechol installation was identified as a \nmild method to activate boron without the need for strong bases, inspired by Renaud and \nAggarwals seminal studies24. Therefore, the corresponding alkyl boronate complexes with low \noxidative potentials (Ep   0.49 V, versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE)) were anticipated \nto undergo facile singleelectron oxidation (Figure 1E). Since the photoexcited iminium ions were \nfound to function as strong oxidants25, it was postulated that the insitu generated catechol boron \nester atecomplexes could be oxidized, resulting in the generation of alkyl radicals."

With the feasibility of the synthesis established, we next addressed the development of hitherto \nunrealised asymmetric TDO cycloadditions. Investigations began with intermolecular (42) \ncycloadditions between indoles and enantioenriched thiophene S,Sdioxides equipped with \ninexpensive, readily available chiral substituents. We were delighted to find that reaction of indole \n(13a) with a TDO substituted with an acyl camphorsultam group31 (14a, R4  5Cl) in CH2Cl2 at 0 \nC afforded tricycle 15a as a single diastereoisomer in high yield. This method was tested on a range \nof substituted indoles, and showed broad functional group tolerance of both electron rich (e.g."

However, their application in synthetic organic chemistry is \nexceedingly rare due to the challenging CH bond cleavage, which typically demands high \ntemperatures and pressures, thereby limiting their utility in the construction of complex organic \nmolecules. In particular, the formation of C(sp2)C(sp3) bonds is crucial for constructing \nbiologically active molecules, including pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals."

In the case of RAERAE coupling, the use of Zn metal is \nwellprecedented to reductively decompose NHPI esters into carbon centered radicals. The different optimal bases in conditions AB were determined empirically and likely \nfulfill different roles silanes can require Lewis base addition to increase hydridic strength19 andor \naccelerate metal hydride formation20 en route to MHAT with alkenes.

In doing so, we also establish \nthe first asymmetric intermolecular cycloadditions of TDOs, accessing tricyclic indoline scaffolds \nthat are of potential utility for medicinal chemistry applications. We further use computational studies \nto reveal the source of the exquisite stereoselectivity observed in the IEDDA reaction, which also \nsuggest that these TDO cycloadditions benefit from an entropic driving force where cheletropic \nextrusion of SO2 occurs spontaneously along the cycloaddition pathway, without formation of an \nintermediate cycloadduct."

The deployment of \nTDOs in targetoriented synthesis remains surprisingly rare20,21, but encouraged by our recent study22 \nin the context of the illudalane sesquiterpenes, we contemplated their application in the construction \nof the Strychnos alkaloids. Deviating from previous examples where TDOs have been used in the de \nnovo construction of polysubstituted benzenes2024, we questioned whether these underexploited \ndienes could also be used to assemble the nonaromatic carbocyclic Strychnos core."

Further enrichment of 14 to 201 \ndr was achieved after a single round of recrystallization from \nhexanesDCM (ca. 101).

The synthesis of highvalue \ntertiary cyanides has been a longstanding challenge. Given the \nprevalence of tertiary alcohols and their accessibility through simple \nnucleophilic addition into ketones and esters, we wondered whether \nour method could be used to access tertiary cyanides from their \ncorresponding alcohols. To our delight, cyclic tertiary alcohols on four, \nfive, six, and sevenmembered saturated heterocycles were converted \nto their corresponding nitriles in good yields (2530, 5167 yield). Additionally, linear alcohols underwent efficient deoxycyanation (31\n33, 5184). A variety of spirocycles and strained cyclic alcohol\ncontaining scaffolds were welltolerated, affording the desired \nproducts in synthetically useful to excellent yields. (3439, 5775 \nyield)."
