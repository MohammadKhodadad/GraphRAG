It is done to act as a barrier to protect either one of the metals from corrupting the other.\\nAdhesion of a plated metal layer to its substrate requires a physical interlocking, inter-diffusion of the deposit or a chemical bonding between plate and substrate in order to work. The role of a diffusion barrier is to prevent or to retard the inter-diffusion of the two superposed metals. Therefore, to be effective, a good diffusion barrier requires inertness with respect to adjacent materials. To obtain good adhesion and a diffusion barrier simultaneously, the bonding between layers needs to come from a chemical reaction of limited range at both boundaries.  Materials providing good adhesion are not necessarily good diffusion barriers and vice versa. Consequently, there are cases where two or more separate layers must be used to provide a proper interface between substrates.']", "length": 1}, {"question": "What tetrahedral building block, composed of silicon and oxygen with the formula SiO4, is a component of zeolites?", "expected": "silica (SiO4)", "context": "Natrolite, Na2(Si3Al2)O102H2O, is a mineral that was named by M.

Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations.

It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state.\\nExtracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C (2,730 \u00b0F), about 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F) higher than that required to smelt copper. Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys \u2013 in some regions, only around 1200 BC. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.\\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, \u22124 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination complexes; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet.

It is an important source of nitrogen which is needed by plants and animals. Bacteria found in the intestines can produce ammonia. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very distinct odor. This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used in smelling salts, many household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaning products. Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. This kind of ammonia is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns into a gas. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields, and is used to make fertilizers for farm crops, lawns, and plants. Many household and industrial cleaners contain ammonia.\\nAmmonia solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% ammonia) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of ammonia dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground. Long term exposure to low concentrations or short term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health conditions from inhalation. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing.\\nAmmonia, anhydrous appears as a clear colorless gas with a strong odor. Shipped as a liquid under its own vapor pressure. Density (liquid) 6 lb / gal. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite. Gas generally regarded as nonflammable but does burn within certain vapor concentration limits and with strong ignition. Fire hazard increases in the presence of oil or other combustible materials. Although gas is lighter than air, vapors from a leak initially hug the ground. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may cause violent rupturing and rocketing. Long-term inhalation of low concentrations of the vapors or short-term inhalation of high concentrations has adverse health effects. Used as a fertilizer, as a refrigerant, and in the manufacture of other chemicals.

Both liquid and vapors extremely irritating, especially to the eyes.\\nAmmonia is an azane that consists of a single nitrogen atom covelently bonded to three hydrogen atoms. It has a role as a nucleophilic reagent, a neurotoxin, a metabolite, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a refrigerant, a mouse metabolite and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is an azane, a mononuclear parent hydride and a gas molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an ammonium. It is a conjugate acid of an azanide.\\nAmmonia is a naturally-occurring compound with a chemical formula NH3 and structure of trigonal pyramidal geometry. It is a colorless gas with a pungent smell, and become NH4, or ammonium ion, when in water. Although ammonia is used as a food additive in the anhydrous form and serves as a starting material in pharmaceutical and commercial products, it is caustic and hazardous when concentrated. Ammonia gas has been used in the clinical setting as a respiratory stimulant to prevent fainting. The radiolabelled form of ammonia, ammonia N 13, is intravenously administered as a radioactive diagnostic agent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Ammonia is a natural byproduct of biological and chemical reactions, including decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals, and animal wastes. It is present in normally present in all tissues constituting a metabolic pool, where it is mostly taken up by glutamic acid and take part in transamination and other reactions, including the synthesis of protein by the Krebs-Hanseleit cycle in the liver. It is proposed that human adults produce about 1000 mmol of ammonia daily, most of which undergoes excretion in the urine.\\nAmmonia is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nAmmonia has been reported in Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and other organisms with data available.\\nAmmonia is an inorganic compound composed of a single nitrogen atom covalently bonded to three hydrogen atoms that is an amidase inhibitor and neurotoxin.

Ammonia is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested.

Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity.

The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease.

It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state.\\nExtracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C (2,730 \u00b0F), about 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F) higher than that required to smelt copper. Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys \u2013 in some regions, only around 1200 BC. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.\\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, \u22124 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination complexes; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.\"]", "length": 3}, {"question": "What is the one-carbon organohalide compound, known for its colorless and flammable properties, that reacts in an aqueous Menshutkin reaction with a nitrogen-based compound which is industrially synthesized under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions using a metallic element (commonly represented by Fe) embedded in a carbon matrix within catalyst sites?", "expected": "chloromethane", "context": "deep neural network) for free energy predictions of condensed phase\nreactions.15,18,19,2328 Many of these studies18,19,2325,28 combine the ML models with semi\nempirical or lowerlevel QMMM methods to obtain the energy predictions that match the\naccuracy of higherlevel QMMM methods.

It is an important source of nitrogen which is needed by plants and animals. Bacteria found in the intestines can produce ammonia. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very distinct odor. This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used in smelling salts, many household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaning products. Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. This kind of ammonia is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns into a gas. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields, and is used to make fertilizers for farm crops, lawns, and plants. Many household and industrial cleaners contain ammonia.\\nAmmonia solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% ammonia) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of ammonia dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground. Long term exposure to low concentrations or short term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health conditions from inhalation. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing.\\nAmmonia, anhydrous appears as a clear colorless gas with a strong odor. Shipped as a liquid under its own vapor pressure. Density (liquid) 6 lb / gal. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite. Gas generally regarded as nonflammable but does burn within certain vapor concentration limits and with strong ignition. Fire hazard increases in the presence of oil or other combustible materials. Although gas is lighter than air, vapors from a leak initially hug the ground. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may cause violent rupturing and rocketing. Long-term inhalation of low concentrations of the vapors or short-term inhalation of high concentrations has adverse health effects.

Both liquid and vapors extremely irritating, especially to the eyes.\\nAmmonia is an azane that consists of a single nitrogen atom covelently bonded to three hydrogen atoms. It has a role as a nucleophilic reagent, a neurotoxin, a metabolite, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a refrigerant, a mouse metabolite and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is an azane, a mononuclear parent hydride and a gas molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an ammonium. It is a conjugate acid of an azanide.\\nAmmonia is a naturally-occurring compound with a chemical formula NH3 and structure of trigonal pyramidal geometry. It is a colorless gas with a pungent smell, and become NH4, or ammonium ion, when in water. Although ammonia is used as a food additive in the anhydrous form and serves as a starting material in pharmaceutical and commercial products, it is caustic and hazardous when concentrated. Ammonia gas has been used in the clinical setting as a respiratory stimulant to prevent fainting. The radiolabelled form of ammonia, ammonia N 13, is intravenously administered as a radioactive diagnostic agent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Ammonia is a natural byproduct of biological and chemical reactions, including decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals, and animal wastes. It is present in normally present in all tissues constituting a metabolic pool, where it is mostly taken up by glutamic acid and take part in transamination and other reactions, including the synthesis of protein by the Krebs-Hanseleit cycle in the liver. It is proposed that human adults produce about 1000 mmol of ammonia daily, most of which undergoes excretion in the urine.\\nAmmonia is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nAmmonia has been reported in Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and other organisms with data available.\\nAmmonia is an inorganic compound composed of a single nitrogen atom covalently bonded to three hydrogen atoms that is an amidase inhibitor and neurotoxin.

Ammonia is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested.

Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity.

Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism.

It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state.\\nExtracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C (2,730 \u00b0F), about 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F) higher than that required to smelt copper. Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys \u2013 in some regions, only around 1200 BC. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.\\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, \u22124 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination complexes; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals.\"]", "length": 3}, {"question": "What is the compound that, when used in an aqueous reaction with a nitrogen-containing substance produced industrially under high-pressure conditions with a catalyst based on the metallic element with atomic number 26, is also known by another name as methyl chloride?", "expected": "chloromethane", "context": "deep neural network) for free energy predictions of condensed phase\nreactions.15,18,19,2328 Many of these studies18,19,2325,28 combine the ML models with semi\nempirical or lowerlevel QMMM methods to obtain the energy predictions that match the\naccuracy of higherlevel QMMM methods.

It is an important source of nitrogen which is needed by plants and animals. Bacteria found in the intestines can produce ammonia. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very distinct odor. This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used in smelling salts, many household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaning products. Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. This kind of ammonia is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns into a gas. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields, and is used to make fertilizers for farm crops, lawns, and plants. Many household and industrial cleaners contain ammonia.\\nAmmonia solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% ammonia) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of ammonia dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground. Long term exposure to low concentrations or short term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health conditions from inhalation. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing.\\nAmmonia, anhydrous appears as a clear colorless gas with a strong odor. Shipped as a liquid under its own vapor pressure. Density (liquid) 6 lb / gal. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite. Gas generally regarded as nonflammable but does burn within certain vapor concentration limits and with strong ignition. Fire hazard increases in the presence of oil or other combustible materials. Although gas is lighter than air, vapors from a leak initially hug the ground. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may cause violent rupturing and rocketing. Long-term inhalation of low concentrations of the vapors or short-term inhalation of high concentrations has adverse health effects. Used as a fertilizer, as a refrigerant, and in the manufacture of other chemicals.

Both liquid and vapors extremely irritating, especially to the eyes.\\nAmmonia is an azane that consists of a single nitrogen atom covelently bonded to three hydrogen atoms. It has a role as a nucleophilic reagent, a neurotoxin, a metabolite, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a refrigerant, a mouse metabolite and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is an azane, a mononuclear parent hydride and a gas molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an ammonium. It is a conjugate acid of an azanide.\\nAmmonia is a naturally-occurring compound with a chemical formula NH3 and structure of trigonal pyramidal geometry. It is a colorless gas with a pungent smell, and become NH4, or ammonium ion, when in water. Although ammonia is used as a food additive in the anhydrous form and serves as a starting material in pharmaceutical and commercial products, it is caustic and hazardous when concentrated. Ammonia gas has been used in the clinical setting as a respiratory stimulant to prevent fainting. The radiolabelled form of ammonia, ammonia N 13, is intravenously administered as a radioactive diagnostic agent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Ammonia is a natural byproduct of biological and chemical reactions, including decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals, and animal wastes. It is present in normally present in all tissues constituting a metabolic pool, where it is mostly taken up by glutamic acid and take part in transamination and other reactions, including the synthesis of protein by the Krebs-Hanseleit cycle in the liver. It is proposed that human adults produce about 1000 mmol of ammonia daily, most of which undergoes excretion in the urine.\\nAmmonia is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nAmmonia has been reported in Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and other organisms with data available.\\nAmmonia is an inorganic compound composed of a single nitrogen atom covalently bonded to three hydrogen atoms that is an amidase inhibitor and neurotoxin. It is both manufactured and produced naturally from bacterial processes and the breakdown of organic matter. Ammonia is used in many industrial processes, and as a fertilizer and refrigerant. It is characterized as a colorless gas or compressed liquid with a pungent odor and exposure occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.\\nAMMONIA SOLUTION, STRONG is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2007 and is indicated for coronary artery disease and has 1 investigational indication.\\nAmmonia is a colorless alkaline gas with a characteristic sharp smell. Ammonia is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested.

It is an important source of nitrogen which is needed by plants and animals. Bacteria found in the intestines can produce ammonia. Ammonia is a colorless gas with a very distinct odor. This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used in smelling salts, many household and industrial cleaners, and window-cleaning products. Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. This kind of ammonia is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns into a gas. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields, and is used to make fertilizers for farm crops, lawns, and plants. Many household and industrial cleaners contain ammonia.\\nAmmonia solutions (containing more than 35% but not more than 50% ammonia) appears as a clear colorless liquid consisting of ammonia dissolved in water. Corrosive to tissue and metals. Although ammonia is lighter than air, the vapors from a leak will initially hug the ground. Long term exposure to low concentrations or short term exposure to high concentrations may result in adverse health conditions from inhalation. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may result in their violent rupturing and rocketing.\\nAmmonia, anhydrous appears as a clear colorless gas with a strong odor. Shipped as a liquid under its own vapor pressure. Density (liquid) 6 lb / gal. Contact with the unconfined liquid can cause frostbite. Gas generally regarded as nonflammable but does burn within certain vapor concentration limits and with strong ignition. Fire hazard increases in the presence of oil or other combustible materials. Although gas is lighter than air, vapors from a leak initially hug the ground. Prolonged exposure of containers to fire or heat may cause violent rupturing and rocketing. Long-term inhalation of low concentrations of the vapors or short-term inhalation of high concentrations has adverse health effects. Used as a fertilizer, as a refrigerant, and in the manufacture of other chemicals.

It has a role as a nucleophilic reagent, a neurotoxin, a metabolite, an EC 3.5.1.4 (amidase) inhibitor, a refrigerant, a mouse metabolite and a NMR chemical shift reference compound. It is an azane, a mononuclear parent hydride and a gas molecular entity. It is a conjugate base of an ammonium. It is a conjugate acid of an azanide.\\nAmmonia is a naturally-occurring compound with a chemical formula NH3 and structure of trigonal pyramidal geometry. It is a colorless gas with a pungent smell, and become NH4, or ammonium ion, when in water. Although ammonia is used as a food additive in the anhydrous form and serves as a starting material in pharmaceutical and commercial products, it is caustic and hazardous when concentrated. Ammonia gas has been used in the clinical setting as a respiratory stimulant to prevent fainting. The radiolabelled form of ammonia, ammonia N 13, is intravenously administered as a radioactive diagnostic agent for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of the myocardium to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Ammonia is a natural byproduct of biological and chemical reactions, including decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals, and animal wastes. It is present in normally present in all tissues constituting a metabolic pool, where it is mostly taken up by glutamic acid and take part in transamination and other reactions, including the synthesis of protein by the Krebs-Hanseleit cycle in the liver. It is proposed that human adults produce about 1000 mmol of ammonia daily, most of which undergoes excretion in the urine.\\nAmmonia is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\\nAmmonia has been reported in Psophocarpus tetragonolobus, Arabidopsis thaliana, and other organisms with data available.\\nAmmonia is an inorganic compound composed of a single nitrogen atom covalently bonded to three hydrogen atoms that is an amidase inhibitor and neurotoxin. It is both manufactured and produced naturally from bacterial processes and the breakdown of organic matter. Ammonia is used in many industrial processes, and as a fertilizer and refrigerant. It is characterized as a colorless gas or compressed liquid with a pungent odor and exposure occurs by inhalation, ingestion, or contact.\\nAMMONIA SOLUTION, STRONG is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2007 and is indicated for coronary artery disease and has 1 investigational indication.\\nAmmonia is a colorless alkaline gas with a characteristic sharp smell. Ammonia is one of the most abundant nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere. It is an irritant with a characteristic pungent odor, which is widely used in industry. Inasmuch as ammonia is highly soluble in water and, upon inhalation, is deposited in the upper airways, occupational exposures to ammonia have commonly been associated with sinusitis, upper airway irritation, and eye irritation. Acute exposures to high levels of ammonia have also been associated with diseases of the lower airways and interstitial lung. Ammonia has been shown to be a neurotoxin that predominantly affects astrocytes. Disturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, factors implicated in the induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition, appear to be involved in the mechanism of ammonia neurotoxicity. Ammonia is formed in nearly all tissues and organs of the vertebrate organism; it is the most common endogenous neurotoxic compounds. Ammonia can affect the glutamatergic and GABAergic neuronal systems, the two prevailing neuronal systems of the cortical structures. Ammonia is well recognized to be central in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy and has been of importance to generations dating back to the early Egyptians. The gut produces ammonia which is metabolized in the liver and almost all organ systems are involved in ammonia metabolism. Colonic bacteria produce ammonia by splitting urea and other amino acids, however this does not explain hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. The alternative explanation is that hyperammonemia is the result of intestinal breakdown of amino acids, especially glutamine. The intestines have significant glutaminase activity, predominantly located in the enterocytes. On the other hand, this organ has only a little glutamine synthetase activity, making it a major glutamine-consuming organ. In addition to the intestine, the kidney is an important source of blood ammonia in patients with liver disease. Ammonia is also taken up by the muscle and brain in hepatic coma, and there is confirmation that ammonia is metabolized in muscle. The excessive formation of ammonia in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients has been demonstrated, and it has been shown that some Alzheimer's disease patients exhibit elevated blood ammonia concentrations. Ammonia is the most important natural modulator of lysosomal protein processing: there is evidence for the involvement of aberrant lysosomal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta-APP) in the formation of amyloid deposits. Inflammatory processes and activation of microglia are widely believed to be implicated in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Ammonia is able to affect the characteristic functions of microglia, such as endocytosis, and cytokine production. Based on these facts, an ammonia-based hypothesis for Alzheimer's disease has been suggested.

It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table. It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, forming much of Earth's outer and inner core. It is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, being mainly deposited by meteorites in its metallic state.\\nExtracting usable metal from iron ores requires kilns or furnaces capable of reaching 1,500 \u00b0C (2,730 \u00b0F), about 500 \u00b0C (932 \u00b0F) higher than that required to smelt copper. Humans started to master that process in Eurasia during the 2nd millennium BC and the use of iron tools and weapons began to displace copper alloys \u2013 in some regions, only around 1200 BC. That event is considered the transition from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. In the modern world, iron alloys, such as steel, stainless steel, cast iron and special steels, are by far the most common industrial metals, due to their mechanical properties and low cost. The iron and steel industry is thus very important economically, and iron is the cheapest metal, with a price of a few dollars per kilogram or pound.\\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are a mirror-like silvery-gray. Iron reacts readily with oxygen and water to produce brown-to-black hydrated iron oxides, commonly known as rust. Unlike the oxides of some other metals that form passivating layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing more fresh surfaces for corrosion. Chemically, the most common oxidation states of iron are iron(II) and iron(III). Iron shares many properties of other transition metals, including the other group 8 elements, ruthenium and osmium. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of oxidation states, \u22124 to +7. Iron also forms many coordination complexes; some of them, such as ferrocene, ferrioxalate, and Prussian blue have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in hemoglobin and myoglobin. These two proteins play essential roles in oxygen transport by blood and oxygen storage in muscles. To maintain the necessary levels, human iron metabolism requires a minimum of iron in the diet.

It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\\nZinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher\\'s wool\" or \"white snow\".\\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. \\nCorrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory.']", "length": 4}, {"question": "Starting with a bluish-white element with atomic number 30 that is commonly used in coatings and alloys and is known for coordinating to ligands in metalloproteins, consider a hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor employed in the treatment of a type of T-cell lymphoma whose mechanism involves binding to that metal in an enzyme\u2019s catalytic pocket.

It has a role as an EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, an apoptosis inducer and an antineoplastic agent. It is a hydroxamic acid and a dicarboxylic acid diamide. It is functionally related to a suberic acid, a hydroxylamine and an aniline.\\nVorinostat is a drug that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the brand name Zolinza for the treatment of a certain type of cancer.Vorinostat is also being studied as an investigational drug as part of a strategy to cure HIV infection.As an investigational HIV drug, vorinostat belongs to a group of drugs called latency-reversing agents.\\nVorinostat (rINN) or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a drug currently under investigation for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), a type of skin cancer, to be used when the disease persists, gets worse, or comes back during or after treatment with other medicines. It is the first in a new class of agents known as histone deacetylase inhibitors.  A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4 - 4.4 months in earlier studies).

Vorinostat is associated with modest rate of minor serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury.\\nVorinostat has been reported in Humicola fuscoatra and Campanularia with data available.\\nVorinostat is a synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative with antineoplastic activity. Vorinostat, a second generation polar-planar compound, binds to the catalytic domain of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). This allows the hydroxamic moiety to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results in the upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest. Hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha tubulin, and heat-shock protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative effects. This agent also induces apoptosis and sensitizes tumor cells to cell death processes.

It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\\nZinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher\\'s wool\" or \"white snow\".\\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. \\nCorrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory.']", "length": 4}, {"question": "Considering that a bluish-white metallic element with atomic number 30 is employed in redox\u2010switchable ring\u2010opening copolymerization and is also chelated by the hydroxamic acid group in a dicarboxylic acid diamide approved for treating cutaneous T cell lymphoma, and knowing that this inhibitor relates to the function of a human class IIb histone deacetylase selective for long, slender polyamines, what is the specific acetylated polyamine produced by the activity of that deacetylase?", "expected": "n1acetylspermidine", "context": "Despite decades of \nintense research on the HDAC family, HDAC10 has received \n\n2 \n\nGood HDAC10\nSubstrates\nH\nN\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nO\nH\nN\nH2N\nN\nH\nOH\ntubastatin A (1)\n7fold HDAC106\nselectivity\n10\nN\nH\nH\nN\nH2N\nH\nN\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nN\nH\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nDKFZ480 (2)\n40fold HDAC106\nselectivity\nHDAC106\ninhibitors\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nN8acetylspermidine (3)\nkcatKM\n  2900 M1s1\nNacetylputrescine (4)\nkcatKM\n  2100 M1s1\nNacetylcadaverine (5)\nkcatKM\n  1300 M1s1\nN\nH\nO\nN1acetylspermidine (6)\nkcatKM\n  24 M1s1\nNbutylacetamide (8)\nkcatKM\n  22 M1s1\nK(Ac)peptides (7)\nkcatKM\n  100 M1s1\nO\nN\nH\nO\nPoor HDAC10\nSubstrates\nSAHA (9)\n\nN\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nO\nN\nH\nn\nm\nazaSAHA derivatives (11)\nDesign\nConcept\nR1\nZincbinding\ngroup\nlinker\ncap group\nR2\nDespite decades of \nintense research on the HDAC family, HDAC10 has received \n\n2 \n\nGood HDAC10\nSubstrates\nH\nN\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nO\nH\nN\nH2N\nN\nH\nOH\ntubastatin A (1)\n7fold HDAC106\nselectivity\n10\nN\nH\nH\nN\nH2N\nH\nN\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nN\nH\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nDKFZ480 (2)\n40fold HDAC106\nselectivity\nHDAC106\ninhibitors\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nN8acetylspermidine (3)\nkcatKM\n  2900 M1s1\nNacetylputrescine (4)\nkcatKM\n  2100 M1s1\nNacetylcadaverine (5)\nkcatKM\n  1300 M1s1\nN\nH\nO\nN1acetylspermidine (6)\nkcatKM\n  24 M1s1\nNbutylacetamide (8)\nkcatKM\n  22 M1s1\nK(Ac)peptides (7)\nkcatKM\n  100 M1s1\nO\nN\nH\nO\nPoor HDAC10\nSubstrates\nSAHA (9)\n\nN\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nO\nN\nH\nn\nm\nazaSAHA derivatives (11)\nDesign\nConcept\nR1\nZincbinding\ngroup\nlinker\ncap group\nR2 wikipedia: ['Histone deacetylase 10 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the HDAC10 gene.

Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\\nZinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher\\'s wool\" or \"white snow\".\\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746.

Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory.']", "length": 4}, {"question": "Which compound, characterized as a specific acetylated form of spermidine with a kcat/KM value of 24 M\u207b\u00b9 s\u207b\u00b9 and produced by a class IIb histone deacetylase known for its selectivity toward long, slender polyamines, results from the activity of that enzyme when it is targeted by a synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative inhibitor\u2014one that treats cutaneous T cell lymphoma by chelating a metallic element commonly used in galvanizing and alloy production?", "expected": "n1acetylspermidine", "context": "Despite decades of \nintense research on the HDAC family, HDAC10 has received \n\n2 \n\nGood HDAC10\nSubstrates\nH\nN\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nO\nH\nN\nH2N\nN\nH\nOH\ntubastatin A (1)\n7fold HDAC106\nselectivity\n10\nN\nH\nH\nN\nH2N\nH\nN\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nN\nH\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nDKFZ480 (2)\n40fold HDAC106\nselectivity\nHDAC106\ninhibitors\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nN8acetylspermidine (3)\nkcatKM\n  2900 M1s1\nNacetylputrescine (4)\nkcatKM\n  2100 M1s1\nNacetylcadaverine (5)\nkcatKM\n  1300 M1s1\nN\nH\nO\nN1acetylspermidine (6)\nkcatKM\n  24 M1s1\nNbutylacetamide (8)\nkcatKM\n  22 M1s1\nK(Ac)peptides (7)\nkcatKM\n  100 M1s1\nO\nN\nH\nO\nPoor HDAC10\nSubstrates\nSAHA (9)\n\nN\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nO\nN\nH\nn\nm\nazaSAHA derivatives (11)\nDesign\nConcept\nR1\nZincbinding\ngroup\nlinker\ncap group\nR2\nDespite decades of \nintense research on the HDAC family, HDAC10 has received \n\n2 \n\nGood HDAC10\nSubstrates\nH\nN\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nO\nH\nN\nH2N\nN\nH\nOH\ntubastatin A (1)\n7fold HDAC106\nselectivity\n10\nN\nH\nH\nN\nH2N\nH\nN\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nN\nH\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nDKFZ480 (2)\n40fold HDAC106\nselectivity\nHDAC106\ninhibitors\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nN8acetylspermidine (3)\nkcatKM\n  2900 M1s1\nNacetylputrescine (4)\nkcatKM\n  2100 M1s1\nNacetylcadaverine (5)\nkcatKM\n  1300 M1s1\nN\nH\nO\nN1acetylspermidine (6)\nkcatKM\n  24 M1s1\nNbutylacetamide (8)\nkcatKM\n  22 M1s1\nK(Ac)peptides (7)\nkcatKM\n  100 M1s1\nO\nN\nH\nO\nPoor HDAC10\nSubstrates\nSAHA (9)\n\nN\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nO\nN\nH\nn\nm\nazaSAHA derivatives (11)\nDesign\nConcept\nR1\nZincbinding\ngroup\nlinker\ncap group\nR2 wikipedia: ['Histone deacetylase 10 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the HDAC10 gene.

It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\\nZinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC.

This allows the hydroxamic moiety to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results in the upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest. Hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha tubulin, and heat-shock protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative effects.

It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\\nZinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher\\'s wool\" or \"white snow\".\\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth).

It is a slightly brittle metal at room temperature and has a shiny-greyish appearance when oxidation is removed. It is the first element in group 12 (IIB) of the periodic table. In some respects, zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth\\'s crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).\\nZinc is an essential trace element for humans, animals, plants and for microorganisms and is necessary for prenatal and postnatal development. It is the second most abundant trace metal in humans after iron, an important cofactor for many enzymes, and the only metal which appears in all enzyme classes. Zinc is also an essential nutrient element for coral growth.\\nZinc deficiency affects about two billion people in the developing world and is associated with many diseases. In children, deficiency causes growth retardation, delayed sexual maturation, infection susceptibility, and diarrhea. Enzymes with a zinc atom in the reactive center are widespread in biochemistry, such as alcohol dehydrogenase in humans. Consumption of excess zinc may cause ataxia, lethargy, and copper deficiency. In marine biomes, notably within polar regions, a deficit of zinc can compromise the vitality of primary algal communities, potentially destabilizing the intricate marine trophic structures and consequently impacting biodiversity.\\nBrass, an alloy of copper and zinc in various proportions, was used as early as the third millennium BC in the Aegean area and the region which currently includes Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kalmykia, Turkmenistan and Georgia. In the second millennium BC it was used in the regions currently including West India, Uzbekistan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, and Israel. Zinc metal was not produced on a large scale until the 12th century in India, though it was known to the ancient Romans and Greeks. The mines of Rajasthan have given definite evidence of zinc production going back to the 6th century BC. The oldest evidence of pure zinc comes from Zawar, in Rajasthan, as early as the 9th century AD when a distillation process was employed to make pure zinc. Alchemists burned zinc in air to form what they called \"philosopher\\'s wool\" or \"white snow\".\\nThe element was probably named by the alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. \\nCorrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and dimethylzinc or diethylzinc in the organic laboratory.']", "length": 4}, {"question": "What is the acetylated spermidine derivative synthesized from the specific human class IIb histone deacetylase enzyme that selectively targets long, slender polyamines and exhibits a catalytic efficiency of 24 M\u207b\u00b9s\u207b\u00b9, considering that this enzyme is counteracted by a synthetic hydroxamic acid inhibitor\u2014approved for treating a type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma\u2014which binds via its hydroxamic acid group to the catalytic pocket containing the essential metallic element with atomic number 30 that facilitates dihydrogen activation?", "expected": "n1acetylspermidine", "context": "Despite decades of \nintense research on the HDAC family, HDAC10 has received \n\n2 \n\nGood HDAC10\nSubstrates\nH\nN\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nO\nH\nN\nH2N\nN\nH\nOH\ntubastatin A (1)\n7fold HDAC106\nselectivity\n10\nN\nH\nH\nN\nH2N\nH\nN\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nN\nH\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nDKFZ480 (2)\n40fold HDAC106\nselectivity\nHDAC106\ninhibitors\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nN8acetylspermidine (3)\nkcatKM\n  2900 M1s1\nNacetylputrescine (4)\nkcatKM\n  2100 M1s1\nNacetylcadaverine (5)\nkcatKM\n  1300 M1s1\nN\nH\nO\nN1acetylspermidine (6)\nkcatKM\n  24 M1s1\nNbutylacetamide (8)\nkcatKM\n  22 M1s1\nK(Ac)peptides (7)\nkcatKM\n  100 M1s1\nO\nN\nH\nO\nPoor HDAC10\nSubstrates\nSAHA (9)\n\nN\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nO\nN\nH\nn\nm\nazaSAHA derivatives (11)\nDesign\nConcept\nR1\nZincbinding\ngroup\nlinker\ncap group\nR2\nDespite decades of \nintense research on the HDAC family, HDAC10 has received \n\n2 \n\nGood HDAC10\nSubstrates\nH\nN\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nO\nH\nN\nH2N\nN\nH\nOH\ntubastatin A (1)\n7fold HDAC106\nselectivity\n10\nN\nH\nH\nN\nH2N\nH\nN\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nN\nH\nO\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nN\nN\nDKFZ480 (2)\n40fold HDAC106\nselectivity\nHDAC106\ninhibitors\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nH2N\nN\nH\nO\nN8acetylspermidine (3)\nkcatKM\n  2900 M1s1\nNacetylputrescine (4)\nkcatKM\n  2100 M1s1\nNacetylcadaverine (5)\nkcatKM\n  1300 M1s1\nN\nH\nO\nN1acetylspermidine (6)\nkcatKM\n  24 M1s1\nNbutylacetamide (8)\nkcatKM\n  22 M1s1\nK(Ac)peptides (7)\nkcatKM\n  100 M1s1\nO\nN\nH\nO\nPoor HDAC10\nSubstrates\nSAHA (9)\n\nN\nN\nH\nO\nOH\nO\nN\nH\nn\nm\nazaSAHA derivatives (11)\nDesign\nConcept\nR1\nZincbinding\ngroup\nlinker\ncap group\nR2 wikipedia: ['Histone deacetylase 10 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the HDAC10 gene.

Vorinostat is associated with modest rate of minor serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury.\\nVorinostat has been reported in Humicola fuscoatra and Campanularia with data available.\\nVorinostat is a synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative with antineoplastic activity. Vorinostat, a second generation polar-planar compound, binds to the catalytic domain of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). This allows the hydroxamic moiety to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results in the upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest. Hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha tubulin, and heat-shock protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative effects. This agent also induces apoptosis and sensitizes tumor cells to cell death processes. Vorinostat crosses the blood-brain barrier.\\nVORINOSTAT is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2006 and has 4 approved and 85 investigational indications.\\nA hydroxamic acid and anilide derivative that acts as a HISTONE DEACETYLASE inhibitor.
