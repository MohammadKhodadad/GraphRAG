The ionized form of malonic acid, as well as its esters and salts, are known as malonates. For example, diethyl malonate is malonic acid's diethyl ester. The name originates from the Greek word \u03bc\u1fb6\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (malon) meaning 'apple'.\n\nHistory: Malonic acid is a naturally occurring substance found in many fruits and vegetables. There is a suggestion that citrus fruits produced in organic farming contain higher levels of malonic acid than fruits produced in conventional agriculture.\nMalonic acid was first prepared in 1858 by the French chemist Victor Dessaignes via the oxidation of malic acid.\n\nStructure and preparation: The structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography and extensive property data including for condensed phase thermochemistry are available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\nA classical preparation of malonic acid starts from chloroacetic acid:\n\nSodium carbonate generates the sodium salt, which is then reacted with sodium cyanide to provide the sodium salt of cyanoacetic acid via a nucleophilic substitution. The nitrile group can be hydrolyzed with sodium hydroxide to sodium malonate, and acidification affords malonic acid. Industrially, however, malonic acid is produced by hydrolysis of dimethyl malonate or diethyl malonate. It has also been produced through fermentation of glucose.\n\nReactions: Malonic acid reacts as a typical carboxylic acid forming amide, ester,  and chloride derivatives. Malonic anhydride can be used as an intermediate to mono-ester or amide derivatives, while malonyl chloride is most useful to obtain diesters or diamides. \nIn a well-known reaction, malonic acid condenses with urea to form barbituric acid. Malonic acid may also be condensed with acetone to form Meldrum's acid, a versatile intermediate in further transformations. The esters of malonic acid are also used as a \u2212CH2COOH synthon in the malonic ester synthesis.\n\nBriggs\u2013Rauscher reaction: Malonic acid is a key component in the Briggs\u2013Rauscher reaction, the classic example of an oscillating chemical reaction.\n\nKnoevenagel condensation: Malonic acid is used to prepare a,b-unsaturated carboxylic acids by condensation and decarboxylation.  Cinnamic acids are prepared in this way:\n\nCH2(CO2H)2  +  ArCHO   \u2192   ArCH=CHCO2H  +  H2O  +  CO2\nIn this, the so-called Knoevenagel condensation, malonic acid condenses with the carbonyl group of an aldehyde or ketone, followed by a decarboxylation.\n\nWhen malonic acid is condensed in hot pyridine, the condensation is accompanied by decarboxylation, the so-called Doebner modification.\n\nPreparation of carbon suboxide: Malonic acid does not readily form an anhydride, dehydration gives carbon suboxide instead:\n\nCH2(CO2H)2   \u2192   O=C=C=C=O  +  2 H2O\nThe transformation is achieved by warming a dry mixture of phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) and malonic acid. It reacts in a similar way to malonic anhydride, forming malonates.\n\nApplications: Malonic acid is a precursor to specialty polyesters. It can be converted into 1,3-propanediol for use in polyesters and polymers (whose usefulness is unclear though). It can also be a component in alkyd resins, which are used in a number of coatings applications for protecting against damage caused by UV light, oxidation, and corrosion. One application of malonic acid is in the coatings industry as a crosslinker for low-temperature cure powder coatings, which are becoming increasingly valuable for heat sensitive substrates and a desire to speed up the coatings process. The global coatings market for automobiles was estimated to be $18.59 billion in 2014 with projected combined annual growth rate of 5.1% through 2022.\nIt is used in a number of manufacturing processes as a high value specialty chemical including the electronics industry, flavors and fragrances industry, specialty solvents, polymer crosslinking, and pharmaceutical industry. In 2004, annual global production of malonic acid and related diesters was over 20,000 metric tons. Potential growth of these markets could result from advances in industrial biotechnology that seeks to displace petroleum-based chemicals in industrial applications.\nIn 2004, malonic acid was listed by the US Department of Energy as one of the top 30 chemicals to be produced from biomass.\nIn food and drug applications, malonic acid can be used to control acidity, either as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulation or natural preservative additive for foods.\nMalonic acid is used as a building block chemical to produce numerous valuable compounds, including the flavor and fragrance compounds gamma-nonalactone, cinnamic acid, and the pharmaceutical compound valproate.\nMalonic acid (up to 37.5% w/w) has been used to cross-link corn and potato starches to produce a biodegradable thermoplastic; the process is performed in water using non-toxic catalysts. Starch-based polymers comprised 38% of the global biodegradable polymers market in 2014 with food packaging, foam packaging, and compost bags as the largest end-use segments.\nEastman Kodak company and others use malonic acid and derivatives as a surgical adhesive.\n\nPathology: If elevated malonic acid levels are accompanied by elevated methylmalonic acid levels, this may indicate the metabolic disease combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA). By calculating the malonic acid to methylmalonic acid ratio in blood plasma, CMAMMA can be distinguished from classic methylmalonic acidemia.\n\nBiochemistry: Malonic acid is the precursor in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), in which it is converted to malonyl-CoA by acyl-CoA synthetase family member 3 (ACSF3). \nAdditionally, the coenzyme A derivative of malonate, malonyl-CoA, is an important precursor in cytosolic fatty acid biosynthesis along with acetyl CoA. Malonyl CoA is formed there from acetyl CoA by the action of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and the malonate is transferred to an acyl carrier protein to be added to a fatty acid chain.\nMalonic acid is the classic example of a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (complex II), in the respiratory electron transport chain. It binds to the active site of the enzyme without reacting, competing with the usual substrate succinate but lacking the \u2212CH2CH2\u2212 group required for dehydrogenation.  This observation  was used to deduce the structure of the active site in succinate dehydrogenase. Inhibition of this enzyme decreases cellular respiration. Since malonic acid is a natural component of many foods, it is present in mammals including humans.\n\nRelated Chemicals: The fluorinated version of malonic acid is difluoromalonic acid.[1]\n\nMalonic acid is diprotic; that is, it can donate two protons per molecule. Its first \n  \n    \n      \n        p\n        \n          K\n          \n            a\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle pK_{a}}\n  \n is 2.8 and the second is 5.7. Thus the malonate ion can be HOOCCH2COO\u2212 or CH2(COO)2\u22122.

        "text2": "Title: Barbituric Acid\nwikipedia: Barbituric acid or malonylurea or 6-hydroxyuracil is an organic compound based on a pyrimidine heterocyclic skeleton. It is an odorless powder soluble in water. Barbituric acid is the parent compound of barbiturate drugs, although barbituric acid itself is not pharmacologically active. The compound was first synthesised by Adolf von Baeyer.\n\nNaming: It remains unclear why Baeyer chose to name the compound that he discovered \"barbituric acid\". In his textbook Organic Chemistry, the American organic chemist Louis Frederick Fieser (1899\u20131977) initially speculated that the name stemmed from the German word Schl\u00fcsselbart (literally, the beard (Bart, Latin: barba) of a key (Schl\u00fcssel), that is, the bit of a key), because Baeyer had regarded barbituric acid as central (or \"key\") to understanding uric acid and its derivatives. However, Fieser subsequently decided that Baeyer had named the compound after a young lady whom he had met and who was called \"Barbara\"' hence the name \"barbituric acid\" was a combination of the name \"Barbara\" and \"uric acid\". Other sources claim that Baeyer named the compound after Saint Barbara, either because he discovered it on the feast day of St. Barbara (December 4) or because he sometimes lunched with artillery officers and St. Barbara is their patron saint.\n\nSynthesis: Barbituric acid was first prepared and named in 1864 by the German chemist Adolf von Baeyer, by reducing what Baeyer called Alloxanbromid (alloxan dibromide, now: 5,5-dibromobarbituric acid) with hydrocyanic acid, and later by reducing dibromobarbituric acid with a combination of sodium amalgam and hydrogen iodide. In 1879, the French chemist \u00c9douard Grimaux synthesized barbituric acid from malonic acid, urea, and phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3). Malonic acid has since been replaced by diethyl malonate, because using the ester avoids the problem of having to deal with the acidity of the carboxylic acid and its unreactive carboxylate.\n\nProperties: The \u03b1-carbon has a reactive hydrogen atom and is quite acidic (pKa = 4.01) even for a diketone species (cf. dimedone with pKa 5.23 and acetylacetone with pKa 8.95) because of the additional aromatic stabilization of the carbanion.\n\nUses: Using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction, barbituric acid can form a large variety of barbiturate drugs that behave as central nervous system depressants. As of 2007, more than 2550 barbiturates and related compounds have been synthesised, with 50 to 55 in clinical use around the world at present. The first to be used in medicine was barbital (Veronal) starting in 1903, and the second, phenobarbital was first marketed in 1912.\nBarbituric acid is a chemical building block in the laboratory synthesis of riboflavin (vitamin B2) and in a method of producing the pharmaceutical drug minoxidil. It is one of the four ingredients in the synthesis of riboflavin. Before barbituric acid was substituted in the synthesis of riboflavin, it was too expensive to synthesize riboflavin.\n\nHealth and safety: Overdose of barbiturate drugs can cause respiratory depression and death. Barbiturates are dependence-producing, and abrupt cessation of high doses can result in a very medically serious, even lethal, withdrawal syndrome. Barbituric acid derivatives are considered DEA Schedule III controlled substances.\n\nSee also: Barbiturase\nThiobarbituric acid\nIsocyanuric acid\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Mahmudov, K.T.; Kopylovich, M.N.; Maharramov, A.M.; Kurbanova, M.M.; Gurbanov, A.V.; Pombeiro, A.J.L.

Coordination Chemistry Reviews. 265: 1\u201337. doi:10.1016/j.ccr.2014.01.002.\n\n\n pubchem:\nBarbituric acid is a barbiturate, the structure of which is that of perhydropyrimidine substituted at C-2, -4 and -6 by oxo groups. Barbituric acid is the parent compound of barbiturate drugs, although it is not itself pharmacologically active. It has a role as an allergen and a xenobiotic. It is a conjugate acid of a barbiturate, a barbiturate(2-) and a barbiturate(1-).\nBarbiturate is a class of drugs characterized as central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Barbiturate compounds bind to the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)-A receptor, thereby increasing the influx of chloride ions into the neuron and subsequently causing hyperpolarization, which produces a decrease in neuronal transmission. Other barbiturate effects in the CNS may include modulation of sodium and calcium channels as well as inhibition of glutamate-mediated excitation. Although the effects of barbiturates are seen throughout the CNS, the predominant effect occurs in the midbrain region, the part of the brain associated with arousal. CNS depressive effects associated with this drug class include mild sedation, hypnosis, anesthesia, and coma as well as a decrease in seizure activity.\nsafety: Irritant\nsmiles: C1C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O\nforumla: C4H4N2O3\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 128.09 g/mol\nXLogP3: -1.5\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 2\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 3\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\nExact Mass: 128.02219199 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 128.02219199 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 75.3\nHeavy Atom Count: 9\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 168\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text1": "Title: Ethylene carbonate\nwikipedia: Ethylene carbonate (sometimes abbreviated EC) is the organic compound with the formula (CH2O)2CO.  It is classified as the cyclic carbonate ester of ethylene glycol and carbonic acid. At room temperature (25 \u00b0C) ethylene carbonate is a transparent crystalline solid, practically odorless and colorless, and somewhat soluble in water. In the liquid state (m.p. 34-37 \u00b0C) it is a colorless odorless liquid.\n\nProduction and reactions: Ethylene carbonate is produced by the reaction between ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide.  The reaction is catalyzed by a variety of cations and complexes:\n\n(CH2)2O  +  CO2   \u2192   (CH2O)2CO\nIn the laboratory, ethylene carbonate can also be produced from the reaction of urea and ethylene glycol using zinc oxide as a catalyst at a temperature of 150 \u00b0C and a pressure of 3 kPa:\n\n(NH2)2CO  +  HO\u2212CH2CH2\u2212OH   \u2192   (CH2O)2CO + 2 NH3\nEthylene carbonate (and propylene carbonate) may be converted to dimethyl carbonate (a useful solvent and a mild methylating agent) via transesterification by methanol:\n\nC2H4CO3 + 2 CH3OH \u2192 CH3OCO2CH3 + HOC2H4OH\nThe transesterfication of ethylene carbonate by methanol can be catalyzed by a high surface area (thermally exfoliated) graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) materials. This method reduces the chance of metal or halide contamination, and can offer yields of up to 60% at a temperature of 393 K.\nDimethyl carbonate may itself be similarly transesterified to diphenyl carbonate, a phosgene-substitute:\n\nCH3OCO2CH3  +  2 PhOH \u2192 PhOCO2Ph + 2 MeOH\n\nApplications: Ethylene carbonate is used as a polar solvent with a molecular dipole moment of 4.9 D, only 0.1 D lower than that of propylene carbonate.\nIt can be used as a high permittivity component of electrolytes in lithium batteries and lithium-ion batteries. Other components like diethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate, dimethyl carbonate and methyl acetate can be added to those electrolytes in order to decrease the viscosity and melting point.\nEthylene carbonate was a universal component of an electrolyte in earlier (prior to ca. 2010) lithium-ion batteries, since it is responsible for the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase on the anode. Since EC is solid at room temperature, it was mixed with propylenecarbonate.  As dimethylcarbonate and other dialkylcarbonates became commercially available, they replaced ethylene carbonate in some modern lithium-ion batteries.\nA typical sodium intercalation type battery would use an electrolyte consisting of: fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) (99%), metallic Na (99.9%), and 1.0 M sodium perchlorate (NaClO4) solutions in ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC), 1:1 v/v% battery-grade, mixed with FEC (10% by weight).\nEthylene carbonate is also used as plasticizer, and as a precursor to vinylene carbonate, which is used in polymers and in organic synthesis.\nOxalyl chloride is produced commercially from ethylene carbonate.

        "text1": "Title: Mirtazapine\nwikipedia: Mirtazapine, sold under the brand name Remeron among others, is an atypical tetracyclic antidepressant, and as such is used primarily to treat depression. Its effects may take up to four weeks but can also manifest as early as one to two weeks. It is often used in cases of depression complicated by anxiety or insomnia. The effectiveness of mirtazapine is comparable to other commonly prescribed antidepressants. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, increased appetite and weight gain. Serious side effects may include mania, low white blood cell count, and increased suicide among children. Withdrawal symptoms may occur with stopping. It is not recommended together with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, although evidence supporting the danger of this combination has been challenged. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe. How it works is not clear, but it may involve blocking certain adrenergic and serotonin receptors. Chemically, it is a tetracyclic antidepressant, and is closely related to mianserin. It also has strong antihistaminergic effects.\nMirtazapine came into medical use in the United States in 1996. The patent expired in 2004, and generic versions are available. In 2022, it was the 105th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Mirtazapine is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.\n\nDepression: Mirtazapine is primarily used for major depressive disorder and other mood disorders. Onset of action appears faster than some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and similar to tricyclic antidepressants.\nIn 2010, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended generic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line choices, as they are \"equally effective as other antidepressants and have a favourable risk\u2013benefit ratio.\" For mirtazapine, it found \"no difference between mirtazapine and other antidepressants on any efficacy measure, although in terms of achieving remission mirtazapine appears to have a statistical though not clinical advantage. In addition, mirtazapine has a statistical advantage over selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in terms of reducing symptoms of depression, but the difference is not clinically significant. However, there is strong evidence that patients taking mirtazapine are less likely to leave treatment early because of side effects, although this is not the case for patients reporting side effects or leaving treatment early for any reason.\"\nA 2011 Cochrane review comparing mirtazapine to other antidepressants found that while it appeared to have a faster onset in people for whom it worked (measured at two weeks), its efficacy was about the same as other antidepressants after six weeks' use.\nA 2012 review focused on antidepressants and sleep found that mirtazapine reduced the time it took to fall asleep and improved the quality of sleep in many people with sleep disorders caused by depression, but that it could also disturb sleep in many people, especially at higher doses, causing restless leg syndrome in 8 to 28% of people and in rare cases causes REM sleep behavior disorder. This seemingly paradoxical dose\u2013response curve of mirtazapine with respect to somnolence is owed to the exceptionally high affinity of the drug for the histamine H1, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors; exhibiting near exclusive occupation of these receptors at doses \u226415 mg. However, at higher doses, inverse agonism and constitutive activation of the \u03b12A-, \u03b12B-, and \u03b12C-adrenergic receptors begins to offset activity at H1 receptors leading to decreased somnolence and even a subjective sensation of \"activation\" in treated patients.\nA 2018 analysis of 21 antidepressants found them to be fairly similar overall. It found tentative evidence for mirtazapine being in the more effective group and middle in tolerability.\nAfter one week of usage, mirtazapine was found to have an earlier onset of action compared to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\nOther: There is also some evidence supporting its use in treating the following conditions, for which it is sometimes prescribed off-label:\n\nSide or adverse effects: A 2011 Cochrane review found that, compared with other antidepressants, it is more likely to cause weight gain and sleepiness, but it is less likely to cause tremors than tricyclic antidepressants, and less likely to cause nausea and sexual dysfunction than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\nVery common (\u226510% incidence) adverse effects include constipation, dry mouth, sleepiness, increased appetite (17%) and weight gain (>7% increase in <50% of children).\nCommon (1\u201310% incidence) adverse effects include weakness, confusion, dizziness, fasciculations (muscle twitches), peripheral edema (swelling, usually of the lower limbs), and negative lab results like elevated transaminases, elevated serum triglycerides, and elevated total cholesterol.\nMirtazapine is not considered to have a risk of many of the side effects often associated with other antidepressants like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and may improve certain ones when taken in conjunction with them. (Those adverse effects include decreased appetite, weight loss, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, urinary retention, increased body temperature, excessive sweating, pupil dilation and sexual dysfunction.)\nIn general, some antidepressants, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can paradoxically exacerbate some peoples' depression or anxiety or cause suicidal ideation. Despite its sedating action, mirtazapine is also believed to be capable of this, so in the United States and certain other countries, it carries a black box label warning of these potential effects, especially for people under the age of 25.\nMirtazapine may induce arthralgia (non-inflammatory joint pain).\nA case report published in 2000 noted an instance in which mirtazapine counteracted the action of clonidine, causing a dangerous rise in blood pressure.\nIn a study comparing 32 antidepressants of all pharmacological classes, mirtazapine was one of the antidepressants most likely to cause nightmare disorder, sleepwalking, restless legs syndrome, night terrors and sleep paralysis.\nMirtazapine has been associated with an increased risk of death compared to other antidepressants in several studies. However, it is more likely that the residual differences between people prescribed mirtazapine rather than a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor account for the difference in risk of mortality.\n\nWithdrawal: Stopping Mirtazapine and other antidepressants may cause withdrawal symptoms. A gradual and slow reduction in dose is recommended to minimize such symptoms. Effects of sudden cessation of treatment with mirtazapine may include depression, anxiety, tinnitus, panic attacks, vertigo, restlessness, irritability, decreased appetite, insomnia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, flu-like symptoms, allergy-like symptoms such as pruritus, headaches, and sometimes mania or hypomania.\n\nOverdose: Mirtazapine is considered to be relatively safe in the event of an overdose, although it is considered slightly more toxic in overdose than most of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (except citalopram). Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine showed no significant cardiovascular adverse effects at 7 to 22 times the maximum recommended dose.\nTwelve reported fatalities have been attributed to mirtazapine overdose. The fatal toxicity index (deaths per million prescriptions) for mirtazapine is 3.1 (95% CI: 0.1 to 17.2). This is similar to that observed with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n\nInteractions: Concurrent use with inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and/or CYP3A4 can result in altered concentrations of mirtazapine, as these are the main enzymes responsible for its metabolism. As examples, fluoxetine and paroxetine, inhibitors of these enzymes, are known to modestly increase mirtazapine levels, while carbamazepine, an inducer, considerably decreases them. Liver impairment and moderate chronic kidney disease have been reported to decrease the oral clearance of mirtazapine by about 30%; severe kidney disease decreases it by 50%.\nMirtazapine in combination with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant as an augmentation strategy is considered to be relatively safe and is often employed therapeutically but caution should be given when combined with fluvoxamine. There is a combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine, sometimes referred to as \"California rocket fuel\". Several case reports document serotonin syndrome induced by the combination of mirtazapine with other agents (olanzapine, quetiapine, tramadol and venlafaxine). Adding fluvoxamine to treatment with mirtazapine may cause a significant increase in mirtazapine concentration. This interaction may necessitate an adjustment of the mirtazapine dosage.\nAccording to information from the manufacturers, mirtazapine should not be started within two weeks of any monoamine oxidase inhibitor usage; likewise, monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not be administered within two weeks of discontinuing mirtazapine.\nThe addition of mirtazapine to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, while potentially having typical or idiosyncratic (unique to the individual) reactions not herein described, does not appear to cause serotonin syndrome. This is per the fact that the 5-HT2A receptor is the predominant serotonin receptor thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of serotonin syndrome (with the 5-HT1A receptor seeming to be protective). Mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, and cyproheptadine, a medication that shares this property, mediates recovery from serotonin syndrome and is an antidote against it.\nThere is a possible interaction that results in a hypertensive crisis when mirtazapine is given to a patient who has already been on steady doses of clonidine.  This involves a subtle consideration, when patients have been on chronic therapy with clonidine and suddenly stop the dosing, a rapid hypertensive rebound sometimes (20%) occurs from increased sympathetic outflow. Clonidine's blood pressure lowering effects are due to stimulation of presynaptic \u03b12 autoreceptors in the CNS which suppress sympathetic outflow. Mirtazapine itself blocks these same \u03b12 autoreceptors, so the effect of adding mirtazapine to a patient stabilized on clonidine may precipitate withdrawal symptoms.\nMirtazapine has been used as a hallucinogen antidote to block the effects of serotonergic psychedelics like psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Mirtazapine is sometimes described as a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), although the actual evidence in support of this label has been regarded as poor. It is a tetracyclic piperazine-azepine.\nMirtazapine has antihistamine, \u03b12-blocker, and antiserotonergic activity. It is specifically a potent antagonist or inverse agonist of the \u03b12A-, \u03b12B-, and \u03b12C-adrenergic receptors, the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and the histamine H1 receptor. Unlike many other antidepressants, it does not inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, nor does it inhibit monoamine oxidase. Similarly, mirtazapine has weak or no activity as an anticholinergic or blocker of sodium or calcium channels, in contrast to most tricyclic antidepressants. In accordance, it has better tolerability and low toxicity in overdose. As an H1 receptor antagonist, mirtazapine is extremely potent, and is in fact one of the most potent H1 receptor inverse agonists among tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants and most antihistamines in general. Antagonism of the H1 receptor is by far the strongest activity of mirtazapine, with the drug acting as a selective H1 receptor antagonist at low concentrations.\nThe (S)-(+) enantiomer of mirtazapine is responsible for antagonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, while the (R)-(\u2013) enantiomer is responsible for antagonism of the 5-HT3 receptor. Both enantiomers are involved in antagonism of the H1 and \u03b12-adrenergic receptors, although the (S)-(+) enantiomer is the stronger antihistamine.\nAlthough not clinically relevant, mirtazapine has been found to act as a partial agonist of the \u03ba-opioid receptor at high concentrations (EC50 = 7.2 \u03bcM).\n\n\u03b12-Adrenergic receptor: Antagonism of the \u03b12-adrenergic receptors, which function largely as inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, enhances adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, notably central 5-HT1A receptor mediated transmission in the dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus; hence, mirtazapine's classification as a NaSSA. Indirect \u03b11 adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of serotonin cell firing and direct blockade of inhibitory \u03b12 heteroreceptors located on serotonin terminals are held responsible for the increase in extracellular serotonin. Because of this, mirtazapine has been said to be a functional \"indirect agonist\" of the 5-HT1A receptor. Increased activation of the central 5-HT1A receptor is thought to be a major mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs.\n\n5-HT2 receptor: Antagonism of the 5-HT2 subfamily of receptors and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptor appears to be in part responsible for mirtazapine's efficacy in the treatment of depressive states. \nMirtazapine increases dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, it was shown that by blocking the \u03b12-adrenergic receptors and 5-HT2C receptors mirtazapine disinhibited dopamine and norepinephrine activity in these areas in rats. In addition, mirtazapine's antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors has beneficial effects on anxiety, sleep and appetite, as well as sexual function regarding the latter receptor. Mirtazapine has been shown to lower drug seeking behaviour (more specifically to methamphetamine) in various human and animal studies. It is also being investigated in substance abuse disorders to reduce withdrawal effects and improve remission rates.\nMirtazapine significantly improves pre-existing symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome in affected individuals. Mirtazapine may be used as an inexpensive antiemetic alternative to Ondansetron. In conjunction with substance abuse counseling, mirtazapine has been investigated for the purpose of reducing methamphetamine use in dependent individuals with success. In contrast to mirtazapine, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and some tricyclic antidepressants increase the general activity of the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT3 receptors leading to a number of negative changes and side effects, the most prominent of which including anorexia, insomnia, nausea, and diarrhea, among others. Its reduced incidence of sexual dysfunction (such as loss of libido and anorgasmia) could be a product of negligible binding to the serotonin transporter (as is generally the cause of sexual dysfunction with most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptors; however, Mirtazapine's high affinity towards and inverse agonism of the 5-HT2C receptors may greatly attenuate those pro-sexual factors (as evidenced by the pro-sexual effects of drugs like m-CPP and lorcaserin which agonize 5-HT2C receptors in a reasonably selective manner). As a result, it is often combined with these drugs to reduce their side-effect profile and to produce a stronger antidepressant effect.\nMirtazapine does not have pro-serotonergic activity and thus does not cause serotonin syndrome. This is in accordance with the fact that it is not a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or monoamine oxidase inhibitor, nor a serotonin receptor agonist. There are no reports of serotonin syndrome in association with mirtazapine alone, and mirtazapine has not been found to cause serotonin syndrome in overdose. However, there are a handful of case reports of serotonin syndrome occurring with mirtazapine in combination with serotonergic drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, although such reports are very rare, and do not necessarily implicate mirtazapine as causative.\n\n5-HT3 receptor: (R)-(\u2013)-mirtazapine is a potent 5-HT3 blocker. It may relieve chemotherapy-related and advanced cancer-related nausea.\n\nH1 receptor: Mirtazapine is a very strong H1 receptor antagonist and, as a result, it can cause powerful sedative and hypnotic effects. A single 15 mg dose of mirtazapine to healthy volunteers has been found to result in over 80% occupancy of the H1 receptor and to induce intense sleepiness. After a short period of chronic treatment, however, the H1 receptor tends to sensitize and the antihistamine effects become more tolerable. Many patients may also dose at night to avoid the effects, and this appears to be an effective strategy for combating them. Blockade of the H1 receptor may improve pre-existing allergies, pruritus, nausea, and insomnia in affected individuals. It may also contribute to weight gain, however. In contrast to the H1 receptor, mirtazapine has only low affinity for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, although anticholinergic side effects like dry mouth, constipation, and mydriasis are still sometimes seen in clinical practice.\n\nPharmacokinetics: The oral bioavailability of mirtazapine is about 50%. It is found mostly bound to plasma proteins, about 85%. It is metabolized primarily in the liver by N-demethylation and hydroxylation via cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4. The overall elimination half-life is 20\u201340 hours, and this is independent of dosage. It is conjugated in the kidney for excretion in the urine, where 75% of the drug is excreted, and about 15% is eliminated in feces.:\u200a430\u200a Desmethylmirtazapine is an active metabolite of mirtazapine which is believed to contribute about 3-10% to the drug's overall effects and has a half-life of about 25 hours.\n\nChemistry: Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic piperazinoazepine; mianserin was developed by the same team of organic chemists and mirtazapine differs from it via the addition of a nitrogen atom in one of the rings.:\u200a429\u200a It is a racemic mixture of enantiomers. The (S)-(+)-enantiomer is known as esmirtazapine.\nAnalogues of mirtazapine include mianserin, setiptiline, and aptazapine.\n\nSynthesis: A chemical synthesis of mirtazapine has been published. The first step of synthesis is a condensation reaction between the molecule 2-chloro 3-cyanopyridine and the molecule 1-methyl-3-phenylpiperazine.\n\nHistory: Mirtazapine was first synthesized at Organon and published in 1989, was first approved for use in major depressive disorder in the Netherlands in 1994, and was introduced in the United States in 1996 under the brand name Remeron.:\u200a429\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nGeneric names: Mirtazapine is the English and French generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip D\u00e9nomination Commune Fran\u00e7aise, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name.

This is in alignment with recent findings that inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A receptors are efficacious in attenuating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease psychosis. As is supported by the common practice of prescribing low-dose quetiapine and clozapine for PDP at doses too low to antagonize the D2 receptor, but sufficiently high doses to inversely agonize the 5-HT2A receptors.\nEight case reports have been reported in five papers on the use of mirtazapine in the treatment of hives as of 2017.\nMirtazapine to alleviate severe breathlessness in patients with COPD or interstitial lung diseases (BETTER-B).\n\nVeterinary use: Mirtazapine also has some veterinary use in cats and dogs.

        "text1": "Title: Carvedilol\nwikipedia: Carvedilol, sold under the brand name Coreg among others, is a beta blocker medication, that may be prescribed for the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (also known as HFrEF or systolic heart failure). Beta-blockers as a collective medication class are not recommended as routine first-line treatment of high blood pressure for all patients, due to evidence demonstrating less effective cardiovascular protection and a less favourable safety profile when compared to other classes of blood pressure-lowering medications.\nCommon side effects include dizziness, tiredness, joint pain, low blood pressure, nausea, and shortness of breath. Severe side effects may include bronchospasm. Safety during pregnancy or breastfeeding is unclear. Use is not recommended in those with liver problems. Carvedilol is a nonselective beta blocker and alpha-1 blocker. How it improves outcomes is not entirely clear but may involve dilation of blood vessels.\nCarvedilol was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1995. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 34th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Carvedilol is indicated in the management of congestive heart failure (CHF), commonly as an adjunct to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and diuretics. It has been clinically shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations in people with CHF. The mechanism of carvedilol in heart failure is due to its inhibition of receptors in the adrenergic nervous system, which releases noradrenaline to the body, including the heart. Noradrenaline is a hormone that causes the heart to beat faster and work harder. Blocking its binding to adrenergic receptors in the heart causes vasodilation, decreases heart rate and blood pressure, and improves myocardial contractility, which ultimately decreases the heart's workload. \nCarvedilol reduces the risk of death, hospitalisations, and recurring heart attacks in patients with moderate to severe heart failure (with an ejection fraction <40%) following a heart attack  Carvedilol has also been proven to reduce death and hospitalization in patients with severe heart failure.\nCarvedilol is not considered a first-line treatment for hypertension; however, research has demonstrated that it exhibits an antihypertensive effect when compared to a placebo or other antihypertensive medications.\nCarvedilol has shown efficacy in preventing bleeding from oesophageal varices in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis and may have benefit in avoiding successive bleeds.\nCarvedilol is used in the treatment of acute cardiovascular toxicity (e.g. overdose) with sympathomimetics, for instance caused by amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, or ephedrine. It has also specifically been found to block the sympathomimetic effects of MDMA. Dual \u03b11 and beta blockers like carvedilol and labetalol may be more favorable for such purposes due to the possibility of \"unopposed \u03b1-stimulation\" with selective beta blockers.\n\nAvailable forms: Carvedilol is available in the following forms:\n\nOral tablet\nExtended-release (24-hour) oral capsule (approved by the FDA in 2006)\n\nContraindications: Carvedilol should not be used in patients with bronchial asthma or bronchospastic conditions due to increased risk of bronchoconstriction. It should not be used in people with second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, sick sinus syndrome, severe bradycardia (unless a permanent pacemaker is in place), or a decompensated heart condition. People with severe hepatic impairment should use carvedilol with caution.\n\nSide effects: The most common side effects (>10% incidence) of carvedilol include:\n\nDizziness\nFatigue\nLow blood pressure\nDiarrhea\nWeakness\nSlowed heart rate\nWeight gain\nErectile dysfunction\nCarvedilol is not recommended for people with uncontrolled bronchospastic disease (e.g. current asthma symptoms) as it can block receptors that assist in opening the airways.\nCarvedilol may mask symptoms of low blood sugar, resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness. This is termed beta blocker induced hypoglycemia unawareness.\n\nInteractions: The risk of bradycardia is increased if used with amiodarone, digoxin, diltiazem, ivabradine, or verapamil. Also, combination of carvedilol with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, including diltiazem and verapamil, enhances it cardiodepressant effects.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Carvedilol is both a non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist (\u03b21, \u03b22) and an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor antagonist (\u03b11). The S(\u2013) enantiomer accounts for the beta-blocking activity whereas the S(\u2013) and R(+) enantiomers have alpha-blocking activity. The affinity (Ki) of carvedilol for the \u03b2-adrenergic receptors is 0.32 nM for the human \u03b21-adrenergic receptor and 0.13 to 0.40 nM for the \u03b22-adrenergic receptor.\nUsing rat proteins, carvedilol has shown affinity for a variety of targets including the \u03b21-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 0.24\u20130.43 nM), \u03b22-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 0.19\u20130.25 nM), \u03b11-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 3.4 nM), \u03b12-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 2,168 nM), 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 3.4 nM), 5-HT2 receptor (Ki = 207 nM), H1 receptor (Ki = 3,034 nM), D2 receptor (Ki = 213 nM), \u03bc-opioid receptor (Ki = 2,700 nM), veratridine site of voltage-gated sodium channels (IC50 = 1,260 nM), serotonin transporter (Ki = 528 nM), norepinephrine transporter (Ki = 2,406 nM), and dopamine transporter (Ki = 627 nM). It is an antagonist of the human 5-HT2A receptors with moderate affinity (Ki = 547 nM), although it is unclear if this is significant for its pharmacological actions given its much stronger activity at adrenergic receptors.\nCarvedilol reversibly binds to \u03b2-adrenergic receptors on cardiac myocytes. Inhibition of these receptors prevents a response to the sympathetic nervous system, leading to decreased heart rate and contractility. This action is beneficial in heart failure patients where the sympathetic nervous system is activated as a compensatory mechanism. Carvedilol blockade of \u03b11-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation of blood vessels. This inhibition leads to decreased peripheral vascular resistance and an antihypertensive effect. There is no reflex tachycardia response due to carvedilol blockade of \u03b21-adrenergic receptors on the heart.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Carvedilol is about 25% to 35% bioavailable following oral administration due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Absorption is slowed when administered with food, however, it does not show a significant difference in bioavailability. Taking carvedilol with food decreases the risk of orthostatic hypotension.\nThe majority of carvedilol is bound to plasma proteins (98%), mainly to albumin. Carvedilol is a basic, hydrophobic compound with a steady-state volume of distribution of 115 L. Plasma clearance ranges from 500 to 700 mL/min. Carvedilol is highly lipophilic and easily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier in animals, and hence is not thought to be peripherally selective.\nThe compound is metabolized by liver enzymes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 via aromatic ring oxidation and glucuronidation, then further conjugated by glucuronidation and sulfation. The three active metabolites exhibit only one-tenth of the vasodilating effect of the parent compound. However, the 4'-hydroxyphenyl metabolite is about 13-fold more potent in \u03b2-blockade than the parent.\nThe mean elimination half-life of carvedilol following oral administration ranges from 7 to 10 hours. The pharmaceutical product is a mix of two enantiomorphs, R(+)-carvedilol and S(\u2013)-carvedilol, with differing metabolic properties. R(+)-Carvedilol undergoes preferential selection for metabolism, which results in a fractional half-life of about 5 to 9 hours, compared with 7 to 11 hours for the S(-)-carvedilol fraction.\n\nChemistry: Carvedilol is a highly lipophilic compound with an experimental log P of 3.8 to 4.19 and a predicted log P of 3.05 to 4.2.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: \n\n== External links ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nCarvedilol is a member of the class of carbazoles that is an adrenergic antagonist with non-selective beta- and alpha-1 receptor blocking properties which helps in the management of congestive heart failure.

It is a member of carbazoles, a secondary alcohol and a secondary amino compound.\nCarvedilol is a racemic mixture where the S(-) enantiomer is both a beta and alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker, and the R(+) enantiomer is an alpha-1 adrenoceptor blocker. It is currently used to treat heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and hypertension.

        "text2": "Title: Propranolol\nwikipedia: Propranolol is a medication of the beta blocker class. It is used to treat high blood pressure, some types of irregular heart rate, thyrotoxicosis, capillary hemangiomas, akathisia, performance anxiety, and essential tremors, as well to prevent migraine headaches, and to prevent further heart problems in those with angina or previous heart attacks. It can be taken orally or by intravenous injection. The formulation that is taken orally comes in short-acting and long-acting versions. Propranolol appears in the blood after 30 minutes and has a maximum effect between 60 and 90 minutes when taken orally.\nCommon side effects include nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation. It may worsen the symptoms of asthma. Propranolol may cause harmful effects for the baby if taken during pregnancy; however, its use during breastfeeding is generally considered to be safe. It is a non-selective beta blocker which works by blocking \u03b2-adrenergic receptors.\nPropranolol was patented in 1962 and approved for medical use in 1964. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Propranolol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Propranolol is used for treating various conditions, including:\n\nCardiovascular: Hypertension\nAngina pectoris (with the exception of variant angina)\nMyocardial infarction\nTachycardia (and other sympathetic nervous system symptoms, such as muscle tremor) associated with various conditions, including anxiety, panic, hyperthyroidism, and lithium therapy\nPortal hypertension, to lower portal vein pressure\nPrevention of esophageal variceal bleeding and ascites\nAnxiety\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nWhile once a first-line treatment for hypertension, the role of beta blockers was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they do not perform as well as other drugs, particularly in the elderly, and evidence is increasing that the most frequently used beta blockers at usual doses carry an unacceptable risk of provoking type 2 diabetes.\nPropranolol is not recommended for the treatment of high blood pressure by the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) because a higher rate of the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to an angiotensin receptor blocker was noted in one study.\n\nPsychiatric: Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety, although evidence to support its use in any anxiety disorders is poor. Its efficacy in managing panic disorder appears similar to benzodiazepines, while carrying lower risks for addiction or abuse. Although beta-blockers such as propranolol have been suggested to be beneficial in managing physical symptoms of anxiety, its efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder remain unestablished. Some experimentation has been conducted in other psychiatric areas:\n\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and specific phobias\nAggressive behavior of patients with brain injuries\nTreating the excessive drinking of fluids in psychogenic polydipsia\n\nPTSD and phobias: Propranolol is being investigated as a potential treatment for PTSD. Propranolol works to inhibit the actions of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), a neurotransmitter that enhances memory consolidation. In one small study, individuals given propranolol immediately after trauma experienced fewer stress-related symptoms and lower rates of PTSD than respective control groups who did not receive the drug. Due to the fact that memories and their emotional content are reconsolidated in the hours after they are recalled/re-experienced, propranolol can also diminish the emotional impact of already formed memories; for this reason, it is also being studied in the treatment of specific phobias, such as arachnophobia, dental fear, and social phobia.  It has also been found to be helpful for some individuals with misophonia.\nEthical and legal questions have been raised surrounding the use of propranolol-based medications for use as a \"memory damper\", including altering memory-recalled evidence during an investigation, modifying the behavioral response to past (albeit traumatic) experiences, the regulation of these drugs, and others. However, Hall and Carter have argued that many such objections are \"based on wildly exaggerated and unrealistic scenarios that ignore the limited action of propranolol in affecting memory, underplay the debilitating impact that PTSD has on those who suffer from it, and fail to acknowledge the extent to which drugs like alcohol are already used for this purpose\".\n\nOther uses: Essential tremor. Evidence for use for akathisia however is insufficient\nMigraine and cluster headache prevention and in primary exertional headache\nHyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)\nInfantile hemangioma\nGlaucoma\nThyrotoxicosis by deiodinase inhibition\nPropranolol may be used to treat severe infantile hemangiomas (IHs). This treatment shows promise as being superior to corticosteroids when treating IHs. Extensive clinical case evidence and a small controlled trial support its efficacy.\n\nContraindications: Propranolol may be contraindicated in people with:\n\nReversible airway diseases, particularly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nSlow heart rate (bradycardia) (<60 beats/minute)\nSick sinus syndrome\nAtrioventricular block (second- or third-degree)\nShock\nSevere low blood pressure\n\nAdverse effects: Propranolol should be used with caution in people with:\n\nDiabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism, since signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia may be masked\nPeripheral artery disease and Raynaud syndrome, which may be exacerbated\nPhaeochromocytoma, as hypertension may be aggravated without prior alpha blocker therapy\nMyasthenia gravis, which may be worsened\nOther drugs with bradycardic effects\n\nPregnancy and lactation: Propranolol, like other beta-blockers, is classified as pregnancy category C in the United States and ADEC category C in Australia. \u03b2-blocking agents in general reduce perfusion of the placenta, which may lead to adverse outcomes for the neonate, including lung or heart complications, or premature birth. The newborn may experience additional adverse effects such as low blood sugar and a slower than normal heart rate.\nMost \u03b2-blocking agents appear in the milk of lactating women. However, propranolol is highly bound to proteins in the bloodstream and is distributed into breast milk at very low levels. These low levels are not expected to pose any risk to the breastfeeding infant, and the American Academy of Pediatrics considers propranolol therapy \"generally compatible with breastfeeding.\"\n\nOverdose: In overdose, propranolol is associated with seizures. Cardiac arrest may occur in propranolol overdose due to sudden ventricular arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock which may ultimately culminate in bradycardic PEA.\n\nInteractions: Since beta blockers are known to relax the cardiac muscle and constrict the smooth muscle, beta-adrenergic antagonists, including propranolol, have an additive effect with other drugs that decrease blood pressure or decrease cardiac contractility or conductivity. Clinically significant interactions particularly occur with:\n\nVerapamil\nEpinephrine (adrenaline)\n\u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists\nSalbutamol (albuterol), levosalbutamol, formoterol, salmeterol, clenbuterol, others\nClonidine\nErgot alkaloids\nIsoprenaline (isoproterenol)\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nQuinidine\nCimetidine\nLidocaine\nPhenobarbital\nRifampicin\nFluvoxamine (slows down the metabolism of propranolol significantly, leading to increased blood levels of propranolol)\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Propranolol is classified as a competitive non-cardioselective sympatholytic beta blocker that crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier. It is lipid soluble and also has sodium channel-blocking effects. Propranolol is a non-selective \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, or beta blocker; that is, it blocks the action of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) at both \u03b21- and \u03b22-adrenergic receptors. It has little intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, but has strong membrane stabilizing activity (only at high blood concentrations, e.g. overdose).   Propranolol can cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects in the central nervous system in addition to its peripheral activity.\nIn addition to blockade of adrenergic receptors, propranolol has very weak inhibitory effects on the norepinephrine transporter and/or weakly stimulates norepinephrine release (i.e., the concentration of norepinephrine is increased in the synapse). Since propranolol blocks \u03b2-adrenoceptors, the increase in synaptic norepinephrine only results in \u03b1-adrenoceptor activation, with the \u03b11-adrenoceptor being particularly important for effects observed in animal models. Therefore, it can be looked upon as a weak indirect \u03b11-adrenoceptor agonist in addition to potent \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonist. In addition to its effects on the adrenergic system, there is evidence that indicates that propranolol may act as a weak antagonist of certain serotonin receptors, namely the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2B receptors. The latter may be involved in the effectiveness of propranolol in the treatment of migraine at high doses.\nBoth enantiomers of propranolol have a local anesthetic (topical) effect, which is normally mediated by blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Studies have demonstrated propranolol's ability to block cardiac, neuronal, and skeletal voltage-gated sodium channels, accounting for its known membrane stabilizing effect and antiarrhythmic and other central nervous system effects.\n\nMechanism of action: Propranolol is a non-selective beta receptor antagonist. This means that it does not have preference to \u03b21 or \u03b22 receptors. It competes with sympathomimetic neurotransmitters for binding to receptors, which inhibits sympathetic stimulation of the heart. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to \u03b21 receptors on cardiac myocytes inhibits activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn inhibits cAMP synthesis leading to reduced Protein kinase A (PKA) activation. This results in less calcium influx to cardiac myocytes through voltage-gated L-type calcium channels meaning there is a decreased sympathetic effect on cardiac cells, resulting in antihypertensive effects including reduced heart rate and lower arterial blood pressure. Blockage of neurotransmitter binding to \u03b22 receptors on smooth muscle cells will increase contraction, which will increase hypertension.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Propranolol is rapidly and completely absorbed, with peak plasma levels achieved about 1\u20133 hours after ingestion. More than 90% of the drug is found bound to plasma protein in the blood. Coadministration with food appears to enhance bioavailability. Despite complete absorption, propranolol has a variable bioavailability due to extensive first-pass metabolism. Hepatic impairment therefore increases its bioavailability. Propranolol can be absorbed along the whole intestine with the main absorption site being the colon, which means people who have lost their colon due to surgery may absorb relatively less percentage of propranolol. The main metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol, with a longer half-life (5.2\u20137.5 hours) than the parent compound (3\u20134 hours), is also pharmacologically active. Most of the metabolites are excreted in the urine.\nPropranolol is a highly lipophilic drug achieving high concentrations in the brain. The duration of action of a single oral dose is longer than the half-life and may be up to 12 hours if the single dose is high enough (e.g., 80 mg). Effective plasma concentrations are between 10 and 100 mg/L. Toxic levels are associated with plasma concentrations above 2000 mg/L.\n\nHistory: Scottish scientist James W. Black developed propranolol in the 1960s. It was the first beta-blocker effectively used in the treatment of coronary artery disease and hypertension.\nNewer, more cardio-selective beta blockers (such as bisoprolol, nebivolol, carvedilol, or metoprolol) are used preferentially in the treatment of hypertension.\n\nSociety and culture: In a 1987 study by the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, it was reported that 27% of interviewed members said they used beta blockers such as propranolol for musical performances. For about 10\u201316% of performers, their degree of stage fright is considered pathological. Propranolol is used by musicians, actors, and public speakers for its ability to treat anxiety symptoms activated by the sympathetic nervous system. It has also been used as a performance-enhancing drug in sports where high accuracy is required, including archery, shooting, golf, and snooker. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, 50-metre pistol silver medalist and 10-metre air pistol bronze medalist Kim Jong-su tested positive for propranolol and was stripped of his medals.\n\nBrand names: Propranolol was first marketed under the brand name Inderal, manufactured by ICI Pharmaceuticals (now AstraZeneca), in 1965. \"Inderal\" is a quasi-anagram of \"Alderlin\", the trade name of pronethalol (which propranolol replaced); both names are an homage to Alderley Park, the ICI headquarters where the drugs were first developed. \nPropranolol is also marketed under brand names Avlocardyl, Deralin, Dociton, Inderalici, InnoPran XL, Indoblok, Sumial, Anaprilin, and Bedranol SR (Sandoz). In India, it is marketed under brand names such as Ciplar and Ciplar LA by Cipla. Hemangeol, a 4.28 mg/mL solution of propranolol, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: Stapleton MP (1997). \"Sir James Black and propranolol.

        "text1": "Title: Mestranol\nwikipedia: Mestranol, sold under the brand names Enovid, Norinyl, and Ortho-Novum among others, is an estrogen medication which has been used in birth control pills, menopausal hormone therapy, and the treatment of menstrual disorders. It is formulated in combination with a progestin and is not available alone. It is taken by mouth.\nSide effects of mestranol include nausea, breast tension, edema, and breakthrough bleeding among others. It is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors, the biological target of estrogens like estradiol. Mestranol is a prodrug of ethinylestradiol in the body.\nMestranol was discovered in 1956 and was introduced for medical use in 1957. It was the estrogen component in the first birth control pill. In 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most birth control pills, although mestranol continues to be used in a few birth control pills even today. Mestranol remains available only in a few countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile.\n\nMedical uses: Mestranol was employed as the estrogen component in many of the first oral contraceptives, such as mestranol/noretynodrel (brand name Enovid) and mestranol/norethisterone (brand names Ortho-Novum, Norinyl), and is still in use today. In addition to its use as an oral contraceptive, mestranol has been used as a component of menopausal hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.\n\nSide effects: \n\nPharmacology: Mestranol is a biologically inactive prodrug of ethinylestradiol to which it is demethylated in the liver (via O-Dealkylation) with a conversion efficiency of 70% (50 \u03bcg of mestranol is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent to 35 \u03bcg of ethinylestradiol). It has been found to possess 0.1 to 2.3% of the relative binding affinity of estradiol (100%) for the estrogen receptor, compared to 75 to 190% for ethinylestradiol.\nThe elimination half-life of mestranol has been reported to be 50 minutes. The elimination half-life of the active form of mestranol, ethinylestradiol, is 7 to 36 hours.\nThe effective ovulation-inhibiting dosage of mestranol has been studied in women. It has been reported to be about 98% effective at inhibiting ovulation at a dosage of 75 or 80 \u03bcg/day. In another study, the ovulation rate was 15.4% at 50 \u03bcg/day, 5.7% at 80 \u03bcg/day, and 1.1% at 100 \u03bcg/day.\n\nChemistry: Mestranol, also known as ethinylestradiol 3-methyl ether (EEME) or as 17\u03b1-ethynyl-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17\u03b2-ol, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is specifically a derivative of ethinylestradiol (17\u03b1-ethynylestradiol) with a methyl ether at the C3 position.\n\nHistory: In April 1956, noretynodrel was investigated, in Puerto Rico, in the first large-scale clinical trial of a progestogen as an oral contraceptive. The trial was conducted in Puerto Rico due to the high birth rate in the country and concerns of moral censure in the United States. It was discovered early into the study that the initial chemical syntheses of noretynodrel had been contaminated with small amounts (1\u20132%) of the 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol (noretynodrel having been synthesized from ethinylestradiol). When this impurity was removed, higher rates of breakthrough bleeding occurred. As a result, mestranol, that same year (1956), was developed and serendipitously identified as a very potent synthetic estrogen (and eventually as a prodrug of ethinylestradiol), given its name, and added back to the formulation. This resulted in Enovid by G. D. Searle & Company, the first oral contraceptive and a combination of 9.85 mg noretynodrel and 150 \u03bcg mestranol per pill.\nAround 1969, mestranol was replaced by ethinylestradiol in most combined oral contraceptives due to widespread panic about the recently uncovered increased risk of venous thromboembolism with estrogen-containing oral contraceptives. The rationale was that ethinylestradiol was approximately twice as potent by weight as mestranol and hence that the dose could be halved, which it was thought might result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism. Whether this actually did result in a lower incidence of venous thromboembolism has never been assessed.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nGeneric names: Mestranol is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip D\u00e9nomination Commune Fran\u00e7aise, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name, while mestranolo is its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana.\n\nBrand names: Mestranol has been marketed under a variety of brand names, mostly or exclusively in combination with progestins, including Devocin, Enavid, Enovid, Femigen, Mestranol, Norbiogest, Ortho-Novin, Ortho-Novum, Ovastol, and Tranel among others. Today, it continues to be sold in combination with progestins under brand names including Lutedion, Necon, Norinyl, Ortho-Novum, and Sophia.\n\nAvailability: Mestranol remains available only in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Chile. It is only marketed in combination with progestins, such as norethisterone.\n\nResearch: Mestranol has been studied as a male contraceptive and was found to be highly effective. At a dosage of 0.45 mg/day, it suppressed gonadotropin levels, reduced sperm count to zero within 4 to 6 weeks, and decreased libido, erectile function, and testicular size. Gynecomastia occurred in all of the men. These findings contributed to the conclusion that estrogens would be unacceptable as contraceptives for men.\n\nEnvironmental presence: In 2021, mestranol was one of the 12 compounds identified in sludge samples taken from 12 wastewater treatment plants in California that were collectively associated with estrogenic activity in in vitro.  \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nMestranol can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\nMestranol is a terminal acetylenic compound that is (17alpha)-17-ethynylestra-1(10),2,4-triene substituted by a methoxy group at position 3 and a hydroxy group at position 17.

        "text2": "Title: Norethynodrel\nwikipedia: Noretynodrel, or norethynodrel, sold under the brand name Enovid among others, is a progestin medication which was previously used in birth control pills and in the treatment of gynecological disorders but is now no longer marketed. It was available both alone and in combination with an estrogen. The medication is taken by mouth.\nNoretynodrel is a progestin, or a synthetic progestogen, and hence is an agonist of the progesterone receptor, the biological target of progestogens like progesterone. It is a relatively weak progestogen. The medication has weak estrogenic activity, no or only very weak androgenic activity, and no other important hormonal activity. It is a prodrug of various active metabolites in the body, such as norethisterone among others.\nNoretynodrel was introduced for medical use in 1957. It was specifically approved at this time in combination with mestranol for the treatment of gynecological and menstrual disorders. Subsequently, in 1960, this formulation was approved for use as a birth control pill. It was the first birth control pill to be introduced, and was followed by birth control pills containing norethisterone and other progestins shortly thereafter. Due to its nature as a relatively weak progestogen, noretynodrel is no longer used in medicine. As such, it is no longer marketed.\n\nMedical uses: Noretynodrel was formerly used in combination with the estrogen mestranol in the treatment of gynecological and menstrual disorders and as a combined birth control pill. It has also been used in the treatment of endometriosis at high dosages of 40 to 100 mg/day. The medication has been discontinued, and is no longer marketed or used medically.\n\nContraindications: No adverse effects have been observed in breastfeeding infants whose mothers were treated with noretynodrel. Because of this, the American Academy of Pediatrics has considered noretynodrel to be usually compatible with breastfeeding.\n\nSide effects: There is a reported case of signs of masculinization in a female infant whose mother was treated with noretynodrel for threatened miscarriage during pregnancy.\n\nOverdose: \n\nInteractions: \n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Noretynodrel has weak progestogenic activity, weak estrogenic activity, and no or only very weak androgenic activity. It is considered to be a prodrug, and for this reason, the metabolites of noretynodrel play an important role in its biological activity. As such, the pharmacodynamics of noretynodrel cannot be understood without reference to its metabolism.\nNoretynodrel is closely related to norethisterone and tibolone, which are the \u03b44-isomer and the 7\u03b1-methyl derivative of noretynodrel, respectively. It is metabolized in a very similar manner to tibolone, whereas the metabolism of norethisterone differs. Both noretynodrel and tibolone are transformed into 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxylated metabolites and a \u03b44-isomer metabolite (in the case of noretynodrel, this being norethisterone), whereas norethisterone is not 3\u03b1- or 3\u03b2-hydroxylated (and of course does not form a \u03b44-isomer metabolite). The major metabolites of noretynodrel are 3\u03b1-hydroxynoretynodrel and to a lesser extent 3\u03b2-hydroxynoretynodrel, formed respectively by 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (AKR1C1\u20134), while the \u03b44-isomer norethisterone is a minor metabolite formed in small amounts.\nTibolone is considered to be a prodrug of both its 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxylated and \u03b44-isomerized metabolites. Noretynodrel is also thought to be a prodrug, as it is rapidly metabolized and cleared from circulation and shows very weak relative affinity for the progesterone receptor (PR), although it appears to form norethisterone in only minor quantities.\n\nProgestogenic activity: Noretynodrel is a relatively weak progestogen, with only about one-tenth of the progestogenic activity of norethisterone. The ovulation-inhibiting dosage of noretynodrel is 4.0 mg/day, relative to 0.4 mg/day in the case of norethisterone. Conversely, the endometrial transformation dosage of noretynodrel is 150 mg per cycle, relative to 120 mg per cycle for norethisterone. In terms of the PR, noretynodrel possesses only about 6 to 19% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRA, whereas the affinity of the two drugs for the PRB is similar (noretynodrel possesses 94% of the affinity of norethisterone for the PRB). Tibolone and the \u03b44-isomer metabolite of tibolone have similar affinity for the PRs as noretynodrel and norethisterone, respectively, whereas the 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone are virtually devoid of affinity for the PRs. Since the structurally related androgen/anabolic steroid trestolone (7\u03b1-methyl-19-nortestosterone) is known to be a potent progestogen, suggesting that a 7\u03b1-methyl substitution does not interfere with progestogenic activity, 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxynoretynodrel likely are devoid of affinity for the PR similarly to the 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone.\n\nAndrogenic activity: Noretynodrel has been said to possess no or only very weak androgenic activity. This is in contrast to norethisterone, which shows mild but significant androgenicity. Relative to norethisterone, noretynodrel has 45 to 81% lower affinity for the androgen receptor (AR). In accordance, no androgenic effects (such as hirsutism, clitoral enlargement, or voice changes) have been observed with noretynodrel even when used in large dosages (e.g., 60 mg/day) for prolonged periods of time (9\u201312 months) in the treatment of women with endometriosis. Additionally, noretynodrel has not been found to virilize female fetuses, in contrast to many other testosterone-derived progestins including ethisterone, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate. However, at least one case of pseudohermaphroditism (virilized genitalia) has been observed that may have been due to noretynodrel. The \u03b44-isomer metabolite of tibolone shows dramatically and disproportionately increased affinity for the AR relative to norethisterone and noretynodrel (5.7- to 18.5-fold greater than that of norethisterone), indicating that the 7\u03b1-methyl group of tibolone markedly increases its androgenic activity and is responsible for the greater androgenic effects of tibolone relative to noretynodrel.\n\nEstrogenic activity: Noretynodrel, unlike most progestins but similarly to etynodiol diacetate, has some estrogenic activity. Relative to other 19-nortestosterone progestins, noretynodrel is said to possess much stronger estrogenic activity. In the Allen\u2013Doisy test of estrogenicity in animals, noretynodrel has been reported to possess 100-fold greater estrogenic activity than norethisterone. Whereas norethisterone has virtually no affinity for the estrogen receptors (ERs), noretynodrel shows some, albeit very weak affinity for both the ER\u03b1 and the ER\u03b2 (in terms of relative binding affinity, 0.7% and 0.22% of that of estradiol, respectively). The estrogenic activity of 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxynoretynodrel has never been assessed. However, while tibolone shows similar affinity for the ERs as noretynodrel, the 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxylated metabolites of tibolone have several-fold increased affinity for the ERs. As such, the 3\u03b1- and 3\u03b2-hydroxylated metabolites of noretynodrel may also show increased estrogenic activity, and this may account for the known estrogenic effects of noretynodrel.\nThe \u03b44-isomer of tibolone, similarly to norethisterone, is virtually devoid of affinity for the ERs. Neither tibolone nor its metabolites are aromatized, whereas trestolone is readily aromatized similarly to testosterone and 19-nortestosterone, and for these reasons, it is unlikely that noretynodrel or its metabolites, aside from norethisterone, are aromatized either. As such, aromatization likely does not play a role in the estrogenic activity of tibolone or noretynodrel. However, controversy on this matter exists, and other researchers have suggested that tibolone and noretynodrel may be aromatized in small amounts to highly potent estrogens (ethinylestradiol and its 7\u03b1-methyl derivative, respectively).\n\nPharmacokinetics: Noretynodrel is rapidly absorbed upon oral administration and is rapidly metabolized, disappearing from the circulation within 30 minutes. In terms of plasma protein binding, noretynodrel is bound to albumin, and show no affinity itself for sex hormone-binding globulin or corticosteroid-binding globulin. The plasma protein binding of its metabolites, such as norethisterone, may differ however.\nThe major metabolites of noretynodrel in the circulation are 3\u03b1-hydroxynoretynodrel (formed by 3\u03b1-HSDTooltip 3\u03b1-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and to a lesser extent 3\u03b2-hydroxynoretynodrel (formed by 3\u03b2-HSDTooltip 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase), and more minor metabolites of noretynodrel are norethisterone (formed by \u03b45-4-isomerase) and possibly ethinylestradiol (formed by aromatase or possibly other cytochrome P450 enzymes, most likely monooxygenases). Due to its very short elimination half-life and its low affinities for steroid hormone receptors in receptor binding assays, noretynodrel is considered to be a prodrug which is rapidly transformed into its active metabolites in the intestines and liver following oral administration. Some researchers have stated that it is specifically a prodrug of norethisterone. According to other researchers however, there is, due to a lack of research, insufficient data to unequivocally show this to be the case at present.\nAbout 1% of an oral dose of noretynodrel is detected in breast milk.\nThe pharmacokinetics of noretynodrel have been reviewed.\n\nChemistry: Noretynodrel, also known as 17\u03b1-ethynyl-\u03b45(10)-19-nortestosterone or as 17\u03b1-ethynylestr-5(10)-en-17\u03b2-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of testosterone that has been ethynylated at the C17\u03b1 position, demethylated at the C19 position, and dehydrogenated (i.e., has a double bond) between the C5 and C10 positions). As such, noretynodrel is also a combined derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone) and ethisterone (17\u03b1-ethynyltestosterone). In addition, it is an isomer of norethisterone (17\u03b1-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) in which the C4 double bond has been replaced with a double bond between the C5 and C10 positions. For this reason, noretynodrel is also known as 5(10)-norethisterone. Few other 19-nortestosterone progestins share the C5(10) double bond of noretynodrel, but examples of a couple that do include tibolone, the C7\u03b1 methyl derivative of noretynodrel (i.e., 7\u03b1-methylnoretynodrel), and norgesterone, the C17\u03b1 vinyl analogue of noretynodrel.\n\nSynthesis: Chemical syntheses of noretynodrel have been published.\n\nHistory: Noretynodrel was first synthesized by Frank B. Colton of G. D. Searle & Company in 1952, and this was preceded by the synthesis of norethisterone by Luis E. Miramontes and Carl Djerassi of Syntex in 1951. In 1957, both noretynodrel and norethisterone, in combination with mestranol, were approved in the United States for the treatment of menstrual disorders. In 1960, noretynodrel, in combination with mestranol (as Enovid), was introduced in the United States as the first oral contraceptive, and the combination of norethisterone and mestranol followed in 1963 as the second oral contraceptive to be introduced. In 1988, Enovid, along with other oral contraceptives containing high doses of estrogen, was discontinued.\nNoretynodrel was first studied in the treatment of endometriosis in 1961 and was the first progestin to be investigated for the treatment of the condition.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nGeneric names: Noretynodrel is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name of the drug while norethynodrel is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name.

        "text1": "Title: Zinc Chloride\nwikipedia: Zinc chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the formula  ZnCl2\u00b7nH2O, with n ranging from 0 to 4.5, forming hydrates. Zinc chloride, anhydrous and its hydrates, are colorless or white crystalline solids, and are highly soluble in water. Five hydrates of zinc chloride are known, as well as four forms of anhydrous zinc chloride. \nAll forms of zinc chloride are deliquescent. Zinc chloride finds wide application in textile processing, metallurgical fluxes, and chemical synthesis. In a major monograph, zinc chlorides have been described as \"one of the important compounds of zinc.\"\n\nHistory: Zinc chloride has long been known but currently practiced industrial applications all evolved in the latter half of 20th century.\nAn amorphous cement formed from aqueous zinc chloride and zinc oxide was first investigated in 1855 by Stanislas Sorel. Sorel later went on to investigate the related magnesium oxychloride cement, which bears his name.\nDilute aqueous zinc chloride was used as a disinfectant under the name \"Burnett's Disinfecting Fluid\". From 1839 Sir William Burnett promoted its use as a disinfectant as well as a wood preservative. The Royal Navy conducted trials into its use as a disinfectant in the late 1840s, including during the cholera epidemic of 1849; and at the same time experiments were conducted into its preservative properties as applicable to the shipbuilding and railway industries. Burnett had some commercial success with his eponymous fluid. Following his death however, its use was largely superseded by that of carbolic acid and other proprietary products.\n\nStructure and properties: Relative to other metal dihalides, zinc dichloride is unusual in forming several crystalline forms (polymorphs).  Four are known: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4. Each case features tetrahedral Zn2+ centers.\n\nHere a, b, and c are lattice constants, Z is the number of structure units per unit cell, and \u03c1 is the density calculated from the structure parameters.\nThe orthorhombic form (\u03b4) rapidly changes to one of the other forms on exposure to the atmosphere. A possible explanation is that the OH\u2212 ions originating from the absorbed water facilitate the rearrangement. Rapid cooling of molten ZnCl2 gives a glass.\nMolten ZnCl2 has a high viscosity at its melting point and a comparatively low electrical conductivity, which increases markedly with temperature. As indicated by a Raman scattering study, the viscosity is explained by the presence of polymers,. Neutron scattering study indicated the presence of tetrahedral ZnCl4 centers, which requires aggregation of ZnCl2 monomers as well.\n\nHydrates: Various hydrates of zinc chloride are known: ZnCl2(H2O)n with n = 1, 1.33, 2.5, 3, and 4.5.  The 1.33-hydrate, previously thought to be the hemitrihydrate, consists of trans-Zn(H2O)4Cl2 centers with the chlorine atoms connected to repeating ZnCl4 chains. The hemipentahydrate, structurally formulated [Zn(H2O)5][ZnCl4], consists of Zn(H2O)5Cl octahedrons where the chlorine atom is part of a [ZnCl4]2- tetrahedera. The trihydrate consists of distinct hexaaquozinc(II) cations and tetrachlorozincate anions; formulated [Zn(H2O)6][ZnCl4]. Finally, the heminonahydrate, structurally formulated [Zn(H2O)6][ZnCl4]\u00b73H2O also consists of distinct hexaaquozinc(II) cations and tetrachlorozincate anions like the trihydrate but has three extra water molecules.\n\nPreparation and purification: Historically, zinc chlorides are prepared from the reaction of hydrochloric acid with zinc metal or zinc oxide. Aqueous acids cannot be used to produce anhydrous zinc chloride.  According to an early procedure, a suspension of powdered zinc in diethyl ether is treated with hydrogen chloride, followed by drying The overall method remains useful in industry, but without the solvent:\n\nZn + 2 HCl \u2192 ZnCl2 + H2\nAqueous solutions may be readily prepared similarly by treating Zn metal, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and zinc sulfide with hydrochloric acid:\n\nZnS + 2 HCl + 4 H2O \u2192 ZnCl2(H2O)4 + H2S\nHydrates can be produced by evaporation of an aqueous solution of zinc chloride. The temperature of the evaporation determines the hydrates For example, evaporation at room temperature produces the 1.33-hydrate. Lower evaporation temperatures produce higher hydrates.\nCommercial samples of zinc chloride typically contain water and products from hydrolysis as impurities. Laboratory samples may be purified by recrystallization from hot dioxane. Anhydrous samples can be purified by sublimation in a stream of hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating the sublimate to 400 \u00b0C in a stream of dry nitrogen gas. A simple method relies on treating the zinc chloride with thionyl chloride.\n\nReactions: \n\nChloride complexes: A number of salts containing the tetrachlorozincate anion, [ZnCl4]2\u2212, are known. \"Caulton's reagent\", V2Cl3(thf)6] [Zn2Cl6], which is used in organic chemistry, is an example of a salt containing [Zn2Cl6]2\u2212. The compound Cs3ZnCl5 contains tetrahedral [ZnCl4]2\u2212 and Cl\u2212 anions, so, the compound is not caesium pentachlorozincate, but caesium tetrachlorozincate chloride. No compounds containing the [ZnCl6]4\u2212 ion (hexachlorozincate ion) have been characterized.  The compound ZnCl2\u00b70.5HCl\u00b7H2O crystallizes from a solution of ZnCl2 in hydrochloric acid. It contains a polymeric anion (Zn2Cl\u22125)n with balancing monohydrated hydronium ions, H5O+2 ions.\n\nAdducts: The adduct with thf ZnCl2(thf)2 illustrates the tendency of zinc chloride to form 1:2 adducts with weak Lewis bases.  Being soluble in ethers and lacking acidic protons, this complex is used in the synthesis of organozinc compounds. A related 1:2 complex is ZnCl2(NH2OH)2 (zinc dichloride di(hydroxylamine)).  Known as Crismer's salt, this complexes releases hydroxylamine upon heating. The distinctive ability of  aqueous solutions of ZnCl2 to dissolve cellulose is attributed to the formation of zinc-cellulose complexes, illustrating the stability of its adducts. Cellulose also dissolves in molten ZnCl2 hydrate.  Overall, this behavior is consistent with Zn2+ as a hard Lewis acid.\nWhen solutions of zinc chloride are treated with ammonia, diverse ammine complexes are produced. In addition to the tetrahedral 1:2 complex ZnCl2(NH3)2. \nthe complex Zn(NH3)4Cl2\u00b7H2O also has been isolated. The latter contains the [Zn(NH3)6]2+ ion,. The species in aqueous solution have been investigated and show that [Zn(NH3)4]2+ is the main species present with [Zn(NH3)3Cl]+ also present at lower NH3:Zn ratio.\n\nAqueous solutions of zinc chloride: Zinc chloride dissolves readily in water to give ZnClx(H2O)4\u2212x species and some free chloride. Aqueous solutions of ZnCl2 are acidic: a 6 M aqueous solution has a pH of 1. The acidity of aqueous ZnCl2 solutions relative to solutions of other Zn2+ salts (say the sulfate) is due to the formation of the tetrahedral chloro aqua complexes such as  [ZnCl3(H2O)]-.   Most metal dichlorides for octahedral complexes, with stronger O-H bonds.  The combination of hydrochloric acid and ZnCl2 gives a reagent known as \"Lucas reagent\".  Such reagents were once used a test for primary alcohols.  Similar reactions are the basis of industrial routes from methanol and ethanol respectively to methyl chloride and ethyl chloride.\nIn alkali solution, zinc chloride converts to various zinc hydroxychlorides. These include [Zn(OH)3Cl]2\u2212, [Zn(OH)2Cl2]2\u2212, [Zn(OH)Cl3]2\u2212, and the insoluble Zn5(OH)8Cl2\u00b7H2O. The latter is the mineral simonkolleite. When zinc chloride hydrates are heated, HCl gas evolves and hydroxychlorides result.\nIn aqueous solution ZnCl2, as well as other halides (bromide, iodide), behave interchangeably for the preparation of other zinc compounds. These salts give\nprecipitates of zinc carbonate when treated with aqueous carbonate sources:\n\nZnCl2 + Na2CO3 \u2192 ZnCO3 + 2 NaCl\nNinhydrin reacts with amino acids and amines to form a colored compound \"Ruhemann's purple\" (RP). Spraying with a zinc chloride solution, which is colorless, forms a 1:1 complex RP:ZnCl(H2O)2, which is more readily detected as it fluoresces more intensely than RP.\n\nRedox: Anhydrous zinc chloride melts and even boils without any decomposition up to 900 \u00b0C.  These unusual properties invite unusual experiments. One of the very rare examples of zinc compounds that are not Zn2+, arise by dissolving zinc metal in molten ZnCl2 at 500\u2013700 \u00b0C. One obtains a yellow diamagnetic solution consisting of the Zn2+2.  The nature of this dimetallic dication has been confirmed by Raman spectroscopy.  Although Zn2+2 is unusual, mercury, a heavy congener of zinc, form a wide variety of Hg2+2 salts, see mercurous.\nIn the presence of oxygen, zinc chloride oxidizes to zinc oxide above 400 \u00b0C.  Again, this observation indicates the nonoxidation of Zn2+.\n\nZinc hydroxychloride: Concentrated aqueous zinc chloride dissolves zinc oxide to form zinc hydroxychloride, which is obtained as colorless crystals:\n\nZnCl2  +  ZnO  +  H2O   \u2192   2 ZnCl(OH)\nThe same material forms when hydrated zinc chloride is heated.\nThe ability of zinc chloride to dissolve metal oxides (MO) is relevant to the utility of ZnCl2 as a flux for soldering. It dissolves passivating oxides, exposing the clean metal surface.\n\nOrganic syntheses with zinc chloride: Zinc chloride is an occasional laboratory reagent often as a Lewis acid. A dramatic example is the conversion of methanol into hexamethylbenzene using zinc chloride as the solvent and catalyst:\n\n15 CH3OH \u2192 C6(CH3)6 + 3 CH4 + 15 H2O\nThis kind of reactivity has been investigated for the valorization of C1 precursors.\nExamples of zinc chloride as a Lewis acid include the Fischer indole synthesis: \n\nRelated Lewis-acid behavior is illustrated by a traditional preparation of the dye fluorescein from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol, which involves a Friedel-Crafts acylation. This transformation has in fact been accomplished using even the hydrated ZnCl2 sample shown in the picture above.  Many examples describe the use of zinc chloride in Friedel-Crafts acylation reactions.\n\nZinc chloride also activates benzylic and allylic halides towards substitution by weak nucleophiles such as alkenes:\n\nIn similar fashion, ZnCl2 promotes selective Na[BH3(CN)] reduction of tertiary, allylic or benzylic halides to the corresponding hydrocarbons.\nZinc enolates, prepared from alkali metal enolates and ZnCl2, provide control of stereochemistry in aldol condensation reactions.  This control is attributed to chelation at the zinc. In the example shown below, the threo product was favored over the erythro by a factor of 5:1 when ZnCl2.\n\nOrganozinc precursor: Being inexpensive and anhydrous, ZnCl2 is a widely used for the synthesis of many organozinc reagents, such as those used in the palladium catalyzed Negishi coupling with aryl halides or vinyl halides.  The prominence of this reaction was highlighted by the award of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Ei-ichi Negishi.\n\nRieke zinc, a highly reactive form of zinc metal, is generated by reduction of zinc dichloride with lithium. Rieke Zn is useful for the preparation of polythiophenes and for the Reformatsky reaction.\n\nUses: \n\nIndustrial organic chemistry: Zinc chloride is used as a catalyst or reagent in diverse reactions conducted on an industrial scale. Benzaldehyde,  20,000 tons of which is produced annually in Western countries, is produced from inexpensive toluene by exploiting the catalytic properties of zinc dichloride.  This process begins with the chlorination of toluene to give benzal chloride.  In the presence of a small amount of anhydrous zinc chloride, a mixture of benzal chloride  are treated continuously with water according to the following stoichiometry:\n\nC6H5CHCl2  +  H2O   \u2192   C6H5CHO  +  2 HCl\nSimilarly zinc chloride is employed in hydrolysis of benzotrichloride, the main route to benzoyl chloride. It serves as a catalyst for the production of methylene-bis(dithiocarbamate).\n\nAs a metallurgical flux: The use of zinc chloride as a flux, sometimes in a mixture with ammonium chloride (see also Zinc ammonium chloride), involves the production of HCl and its subsequent reaction with surface oxides.\nZinc chloride forms two salts with ammonium chloride: [NH4]2[ZnCl4] and [NH4]3[ZnCl4]Cl, which decompose on heating liberating HCl, just as zinc chloride hydrate does. The action of zinc chloride/ammonium chloride fluxes, for example, in the hot-dip galvanizing process produces H2 gas and ammonia fumes.\n\nIn textile and paper processing: Relevant to its affinity for these materials, ZnCl2 is used as a fireproofing agent and in fabric \"refresheners\" such as Febreze. Vulcanized fibre is made by soaking paper in concentrated zinc chloride.\n\nSafety and health: Zinc and chloride are essential for life.  Zn2+ is a component of several enzymes, e.g., carboxypeptidase and carbonic anhydrase.  Thus, aqueous solutions of zinc chlorides are rarely problematic as an acute poison. Anhydrous zinc chloride is however an aggressive Lewis acid as it can burn skin and other tissues.  Ingestion of zinc chloride, often from soldering flux, requires endoscopic monitoring.  Another source of zinc chloride is zinc chloride smoke mixture (\"HC\") used in smoke grenades. Containing zinc oxide, hexachloroethane, and aluminium powder, release zinc chloride, carbon and aluminium oxide smoke, an effective smoke screen.  Such smoke screens can lead to fatalities.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: N. N. Greenwood, A. Earnshaw, Chemistry of the Elements, 2nd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, Oxford, UK, 1997.\nLide, D.

It is soluble in water. It is corrosive to metals and therefore irritating to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes. It is used for preserving wood, in soldering fluxes, as a catalyst in chemical metals and manufacturing, and for many other uses.\nZinc chloride, solution is a colorless liquid. It is mildly corrosive to metals. It causes burns to eyes, skin and mucous membranes.\nZinc chloride is a solution of ions indicated for use in total parenteral nutrition to maintain zinc levels and prevent deficiency syndromes.  Zinc chloride was granted FDA approval before 26 June 1986.\nZinc Chloride is an ionic salt essential for the synthesis of cholesterol, protein, and fats. Zinc plays an important role in the proper functioning of the immune system. Zinc is required for the enzyme activities necessary for cell division, cell growth, and wound healing as well as the release of vitamin A from the liver. It plays a role in the acuity of the senses of smell and taste and is required to maintain prostate reproductive health and insulin function. Zinc is also involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates. Zinc chloride is administered orally or parenterally as a nutritional supplement.\nZinc chloride is a nutrient supplement A number of salts containing the tetrachlorozincate anion, ZnCl2 4, are known. Caulton's reagent, V2Cl3(thf)6Zn2Cl6 is an example of a salt containing Zn2Cl2 6. The compound Cs3ZnCl5 contains tetrahedral ZnCl2 4 and Cl anions. No compounds containing the ZnCl4 6 ion have been characterized. Four crystalline forms, (polymorphs) , of ZnCl2 are known, and in each case the Zn2+ ions are trigonal planar coordinated to four chloride ions. The pure anhydrous orthorhombic form rapidly changes to one of the other forms on exposure to the atmosphere and a possible explanation is that the presence of OH facilitates the rearrangement. Rapid cooling of molten ZnCl2 gives a glass, that is, a rigid amorphous solid and this ability has been related to the structure in the melt.<br /> Zinc chloride belongs to the family of Transition Metal Chlorides.

        "text2": "Title: Methylene Chloride\nwikipedia: Dichloromethane (DCM, methylene chloride, or methylene bichloride) is an organochlorine compound with the formula CH2Cl2. This colorless, volatile liquid with a chloroform-like, sweet odor is widely used as a solvent. Although it is not miscible with water, it is slightly polar, and miscible with many organic solvents.\n\nOccurrence: Natural sources of dichloromethane include oceanic sources, macroalgae, wetlands, and volcanoes.  However, the majority of dichloromethane in the environment is the result of industrial emissions.\n\nProduction: DCM is produced by treating either chloromethane or methane with chlorine gas at 400\u2013500 \u00b0C. At these temperatures, both methane and chloromethane undergo a series of reactions producing progressively more chlorinated products.  In this way, an estimated 400,000 tons were produced in the US, Europe, and Japan in 1993.\n\nCH4 + Cl2 \u2192 CH3Cl + HCl\nCH3Cl + Cl2 \u2192 CH2Cl2 + HCl\nCH2Cl2 + Cl2 \u2192 CHCl3 + HCl\nCHCl3 + Cl2 \u2192 CCl4 + HCl\nThe output of these processes is a mixture of chloromethane, dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride as well as hydrogen chloride as a byproduct. These compounds are separated by distillation.\nDCM was first prepared in 1839 by the French chemist Henri Victor Regnault (1810\u20131878), who isolated it from a mixture of chloromethane and chlorine that had been exposed to sunlight.\n\nUses: DCM's volatility and ability to dissolve a wide range of organic compounds makes it a useful solvent for many chemical processes.  In the food industry, it is used to decaffeinate coffee and tea as well as to prepare extracts of hops and other flavourings. Its volatility has led to its use as an aerosol spray propellant and as a blowing agent for polyurethane foams.\n\nSpecialized uses: The chemical compound's low boiling point allows the chemical to function in a heat engine that can extract mechanical energy from small temperature differences. An example of a DCM heat engine is the drinking bird. The toy works at room temperature. It is also used as the fluid in jukebox displays and holiday bubble lights that have a colored bubbling tube above a lamp as a source of heat and a small amount of rock salt to provide thermal mass and a nucleation site for the phase changing solvent.\nDCM chemically welds certain plastics. For example, it is used to seal the casing of electric meters. Often sold as a main component of plastic welding adhesives, it is also used extensively by model building hobbyists for joining plastic components together. It is commonly referred to as \"Di-clo\".\nIt is used in the garment printing industry for removal of heat-sealed garment transfers.\nDCM is used in the material testing field of civil engineering; specifically it is used during the testing of bituminous materials as a solvent to separate the binder from the aggregate of an asphalt or macadam to allow the testing of the materials.\nDichloromethane extract of Asparagopsis taxiformis, a seaweed fodder for cattle, has been found to reduce their methane emissions by 79%.\nIt has been used as the principal component of various paint and lacquer strippers, although its use is now restricted in the EU and many such products now use benzyl alcohol as a safer alternative.\n\nChemical reactions: Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent in part because it is relatively inert.  It does participate in reactions with certain strong nucleophiles however. Tert-butyllithium deprotonates DCM:\n\nH2CCl2  +  RLi   \u2192   HCCl2Li  +  RH\nMethyllithium reacts with methylene chloride to give chlorocarbene:\n\nCH2Cl2  +  CH3Li   \u2192   CHCl  +  CH4  +  LiCl\nAlthough DCM is a common solvent in organic chemistry laboratories and is commonly assumed to be inert, it does react with some amines and triazoles. Tertiary amines can react with DCM to form quaternary chloromethyl chloride salts via the Menshutkin reaction. Secondary amines can react with DCM to yield an equilibrium of iminium chlorides and chloromethyl chlorides, which can react with a second equivalent of the secondary amine to form aminals. At increased temperatures, pyridines including DMAP, react with DCM to form methylene bispyridinium dichlorides. Hydroxybenzotriazole and related reagents used in peptide coupling react with DCM in the presence of triethylamine, forming acetals.\n\nToxicity: Serious health risks are associated with DCM, despite being one of the least toxic simple chlorohydrocarbons. Its high volatility makes it an inhalation hazard. It can also be absorbed through the skin. \nSymptoms of acute overexposure to dichloromethane via inhalation include difficulty concentrating, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, headaches, numbness, weakness, and irritation of the upper respiratory tract and eyes. More severe consequences can include suffocation, loss of consciousness, coma, and death.\nDCM is also metabolized to carbon monoxide potentially leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. Acute exposure by inhalation has resulted in optic neuropathy and hepatitis. Prolonged skin contact can result in DCM dissolving some of the fatty tissues in skin, resulting in skin irritation or chemical burns.\nIt may be carcinogenic, as it has been linked to cancer of the lungs, liver, and pancreas in laboratory animals. Other animal studies showed breast cancer and salivary gland cancer. Research is not yet clear as to what levels may be carcinogenic to humans. DCM crosses the placenta but fetal toxicity in women who are exposed to it during pregnancy has not been proven. In animal experiments, it was fetotoxic at doses that were maternally toxic but no teratogenic effects were seen.\nIn people with pre-existing heart problems, exposure to DCM can cause abnormal heart rhythms and/or heart attacks, sometimes without any other symptoms of overexposure. People with existing liver, nervous system, or skin problems may worsen after exposure to methylene chloride.\n\nRegulation: In many countries, products containing DCM must carry labels warning of its health risks. Concerns about its health effects have led to a search for alternatives in many of its applications.\nIn the European Union, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values (SCOEL) recommends an occupational exposure limit for DCM of 100 ppm (8-hour time-weighted average) and a short-term exposure limit of 200 ppm for a 15-minute period. The European Parliament voted in 2009 to ban the use of DCM in paint-strippers for consumers and many professionals, with the ban taking effect in December 2010.\nIn February 2013, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health warned that at least 14 bathtub refinishers have died since 2000 from DCM exposure. These workers had been working alone, in poorly ventilated bathrooms, with inadequate or no respiratory protection, and no training about the hazards of DCM. OSHA has since then issued a DCM standard.\nOn March 15, 2019, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to prohibit the manufacture (including importing and exporting), processing, and distribution of DCM in all paint removers for consumer use, effective in 180 days. However, it does not affect other products containing DCM, including many consumer products not intended for paint removal. On April 20, 2023, the EPA proposed a widespread ban on the production of DCM with some exceptions for military and industrial uses. On April 30, 2024, the EPA finalized a ban on most commercial uses of DCM, which mainly banned its application for stripping paint and degreasing surfaces but allowed for some remaining commercial applications, such as chemical production.\n\nEnvironmental effects: Dichloromethane is not classified as an ozone-depleting substance by the Montreal Protocol.  The US Clean Air Act does not regulate dichloromethane as an ozone depleter.  Dichloromethane has been classified as a very short-lived substance (VSLS). Despite their short atmospheric lifetimes of less than 0.5 year, VSLSs can contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, particularly if emitted in regions where rapid transport to the stratosphere occurs. Atmospheric abundances of dichloromethane have been increasing in recent years.\n\nSee also: Deuterated dichloromethane\nChloromethane\nTrichloromethane\nTetrachloromethane\nList of organic compounds\nCarbon monoxide-releasing molecules\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \nInternational Chemical Safety Card 0058\nNIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards. \"#0414\".

A dense, non-flammible colourless liquid at room temperature (b.p. 40\u2103, d = 1.33) which is immiscible with water, it is widely used as a solvent, a paint stripper, and for the removal of caffeine from coffee and tea. It has a role as a polar aprotic solvent, a carcinogenic agent and a refrigerant. It is a member of chloromethanes and a volatile organic compound.\nMethylene chloride is predominantly used as a solvent. The acute (short-term) effects of methylene chloride inhalation in humans consist mainly of nervous system effects including decreased visual, auditory, and motor functions, but these effects are reversible once exposure ceases. The effects of chronic (long-term) exposure to methylene chloride suggest that the central nervous system (CNS) is a potential target in humans and animals. Human data are inconclusive regarding methylene chloride and cancer. Animal studies have shown increases in liver and lung cancer and benign mammary gland tumors following the inhalation of methylene chloride.\nMethylene Chloride has been reported in Garcinia mangostana, Biflustra perfragilis, and Cynara cardunculus with data available.\nMethylene Chloride is a clear, colorless, nonflammable, volatile liquid chlorinated hydrocarbon with a sweet, pleasant smell and emits highly toxic fumes of phosgene when heated to decomposition. Methylene chloride is primarily used as a solvent in paint removers, but is also used in aerosol formulations, as a solvent in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, as a degreasing agent, in electronics manufacturing and as an ethane foam blowing agent. Inhalation exposure to this substance irritates the nose and throat and affects the central nervous system.

        "text1": "Title: Lidocaine\nwikipedia: Lidocaine, also known as lignocaine and sold under the brand name Xylocaine among others, is a local anesthetic of the amino amide type. It is also used to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. When used for local anaesthesia or in nerve blocks, lidocaine typically begins working within several minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area. It is often used mixed with a small amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) to prolong its local effects and to decrease bleeding.\nIf injected intravenously, it may cause cerebral effects such as confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine. Lidocaine is an antiarrhythmic medication of the class Ib type. This means it works by blocking sodium channels thus decreasing the rate of contractions of the heart. When injected near nerves, the nerves cannot conduct signals to or from the brain.\nLidocaine was discovered in 1946 and went on sale in 1948. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 262nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nLocal numbing agent: The efficacy profile of lidocaine as a local anaesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action.\nLidocaine is one of the most commonly used local anaesthetics in dentistry. It can be administered in multiple ways, most often as a nerve block or infiltration, depending on the type of treatment carried out and the area of the mouth worked on.\nFor surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures. There is tentative evidence for topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain and skin graft donor site pain. As a local numbing agent, it is used for the treatment of premature ejaculation.\nAn adhesive transdermal patch containing a 5% concentration of lidocaine in a hydrogel bandage, is approved by the US FDA for reducing nerve pain caused by shingles. The transdermal patch is also used for pain from other causes, such as compressed nerves and persistent nerve pain after some surgeries.\n\nHeart arrhythmia: Lidocaine is a common class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventive dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.\n\nEpilepsy: A 2013 review on treatment for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous lidocaine as a second-line treatment, if phenobarbital fails to stop seizures.\n\nOther: Intravenous lidocaine infusions are also used to treat chronic pain and acute surgical pain as an opiate sparing technique. The quality of evidence for this use is poor so it is difficult to compare it to placebo or an epidural.\nInhaled lidocaine can be used as a cough suppressor acting peripherally to reduce the cough reflex. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for people needing intubation, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia.\nA 2019 systematic review of the literature found that intraurethral lidocaine reduces pain in men who undergo cystoscopic procedures. \nLidocaine, along with ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, may also help in treating jellyfish stings, both numbing the affected area and preventing further nematocyst discharge.\nFor gastritis, drinking a viscous lidocaine formulation may help with the pain. \nA 2021 study found that lidocaine 5% spray on glans penis 10-20 minutes prior to sexual intercourse significantly improves premature ejaculation. Another study found that lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% is effective in premature ejaculation and 20 minutes of application time before sexual intercourse.\n\nAdverse effects: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when lidocaine is used as a local anesthetic and is administered correctly. Most ADRs associated with lidocaine for anesthesia relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, and allergic reactions only rarely occur. Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly results in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects \u2013 CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. ADRs by individual organ systems are:\n\nCNS excitation: nervousness, agitation, anxiety, apprehension, tingling around the mouth (circumoral paraesthesia), headache, hyperesthesia, tremor, dizziness, pupillary changes, psychosis, euphoria, hallucinations, and seizures\nCNS depression with increasingly heavier exposure: drowsiness, lethargy, slurred speech, hypoesthesia, confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnoea.\nCardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, flushing, venous insufficiency, increased defibrillator threshold, edema, and/or cardiac arrest \u2013 some of which may be due to hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression.\nRespiratory: bronchospasm, dyspnea, respiratory depression or arrest\nGastrointestinal: metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, agita, and diarrhea\nEars: tinnitus\nEyes: local burning, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal epithelial changes/ulceration, diplopia, visual changes (opacification)\nSkin: itching, depigmentation, rash, urticaria, edema, angioedema, bruising, inflammation of the vein at the injection site, irritation of the skin when applied topically\nBlood: methemoglobinemia\nAllergy\nADRs associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine are similar to the toxic effects of systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (\u22653 mg/min). Common ADRs include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs associated with the use of lidocaine include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression.\nIt is generally safe to use lidocaine with vasoconstrictors such as adrenaline, including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers, and toes. While concerns of tissue death, if used in these areas, have been raised, the evidence does not support these concerns.\nThe use of lidocaine for spinal anesthesia may lead to an increased risk of transient neurological symptoms, a painful condition that is sometimes experienced immediately after surgery. There is some weak evidence to suggest that the use of alternative anesthetic medications such as prilocaine, procaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or levobupivacaine may decrease the risk of a person developing transient neurological symptoms. Low-quality evidence suggests that 2\u2010chloroprocaine and mepivacaine when used for spinal anesthetic have a similar risk of the person developing transient neurological symptoms as lidocaine.\n\nInteractions: Any drugs that are also ligands of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 can potentially increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of methemoglobinemia should also be considered carefully. Dronedarone and liposomal morphine are both absolutely a contraindication, as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction.\n\nContraindications: Absolute contraindications for the use of lidocaine include:\n\nHeart block, second or third degree (without pacemaker)\nSevere sinoatrial block (without pacemaker)\nSerious adverse drug reaction to lidocaine or amide local anesthetics\nHypersensitivity to corn and corn-related products (corn-derived dextrose is used in the mixed injections)\nConcurrent treatment with quinidine, flecainide, disopyramide, procainamide (class I antiarrhythmic agents)\nPrior use of amiodarone hydrochloride\nAdams\u2013Stokes syndrome\nWolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome\nLidocaine viscous is not recommended by the FDA to treat teething pain in children and infants.\nExercise caution in people with any of these:\n\nHypotension not due to arrhythmia\nBradycardia\nAccelerated idioventricular rhythm\nElderly\nEhlers\u2013Danlos syndromes; efficiency of local anesthetics can be reduced\nPseudocholinesterase deficiency\nIntra-articular infusion (this is not an approved indication and can cause chondrolysis)\nPorphyria, especially acute intermittent porphyria; lidocaine has been classified as porphyrogenic because of the hepatic enzymes it induces, although clinical evidence suggests it is not. Bupivacaine is a safe alternative in this case.\nImpaired liver function \u2013 people with lowered hepatic function may have an adverse reaction with repeated administration of lidocaine because the drug is metabolized by the liver. Adverse reactions may include neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, nausea, muscle twitches, vomiting, or seizures).\n\nOverdosage: Overdoses of lidocaine may result from excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children (who are more susceptible to overdose), accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or from prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgery. The maximum safe dose is 3 mg per kg.\nSuch overdoses have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults (local anesthetic systemic toxicity). Symptoms include central nervous system manifestations such as numbness of the tongue, dizziness, tinnitus, visual disturbances, convulsions, reduced consciousness progressing to coma, as well as respiratory arrest and cardiovascular disturbances. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. \nLidocaine is often given intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parenteral feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more common.\n\nPostarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis: Lidocaine in large amounts may be toxic to cartilage and intra-articular infusions can lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nMechanism of action: Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by prolonging the inactivation of the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for action potential propagation. With sufficient blockage, the voltage-gated sodium channels will not open and an action potential will not be generated. Careful titration allows for a high degree of selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other types of neurons.\nThe same principle applies to this drug's actions in the heart. Blocking sodium channels in the conduction system, as well as the muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia.\n\nPharmacokinetics: When used as an injectable it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The volume of distribution is 1.1 L/kg to 2.1 L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%. Lidocaine efficacy may be reduced in tissues that are inflamed, due to competing inflammatory mediators.\nThe elimination half-life of lidocaine is biphasic and around 90 min to 120 min in most people. This may be prolonged in people with hepatic impairment (average 343 min) or congestive heart failure (average 136 min). Lidocaine is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug).\n\nChemistry: \n\nMolecular structure and conformational flexibility: Lidocaine's 1,5-dimethylbenzene group gives it hydrophobic properties. In addition to this aromatic unit, lidocaine has an aliphatic section comprising amide, carbonyl, and enyl groups.\nLidocaine exhibits a remarkable degree of conformational flexibility, resulting in more than 60 probable conformers. This adaptability arises from the high lability of the amide and ethyl groups within the molecule. These groups can undergo shifts in their positions, leading to significant variations in the overall molecular configuration.\n\nInfluence of temperature and pressure on conformational preference: The dynamic transformation of lidocaine conformers in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) highly depends on external factors such as pressure and temperature. Alterations in these conditions can lead to distinct conformations, impacting the molecule's physicochemical properties. One notable consequence of these variations is the particle size of lidocaine when produced through micronization using scCO2. Changes in the position of the amide group within the molecule can trigger a redistribution of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, affecting the outcome of the micronization process and the resultant particle size.\n\nVeterinary use: Lidocaine is commonly used in veterinary medicine in both companion and production animals around the world and is listed as an essential veterinary medicine by the World Veterinary Association and also the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.[1]  \nIn veterinary medicine, it is commonly used as a local anaesthetic both as an injectable or topical product. It provides excellent local anaesthesia when given by local infiltration into a tissue or via specific nerve blocks. These are commonly applied to nerves of the head, limbs, thorax, and spine. It can also be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias when given intravenously. In most veterinary species, when given via injection, it has a rapid onset of action (2-10 minutes) with a duration of action of 30-60 minutes. \nIn veterinary species, its metabolism is much the same as humans with rapid metabolism in the liver to the major metabolites MEGX (monoethylglycine xylidide) and GX (glycine xylidide) that retain partial activity against sodium channels. These compounds are further metabolized to monoethylglycine and xylidide, respectively.\nToxicity in animals is similar to that seen in humans with both toxicity to the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system observed. General the CNS signs are seen first with agitation and muscle twitching seen before the cardiovascular signs of hypotension, myocardial depression, and arrhythmias. Further CNS depression will result from higher doses with seizures and convulsions and eventually apnea and death.\nIt is a component of the veterinary drug Tributame along with embutramide and chloroquine used to carry out euthanasia on horses and dogs.\n\nHistory: Lidocaine, the first amino amide\u2013type local anesthetic (previous were amino esters), was first synthesized under the name 'xylocaine' by Swedish chemist Nils L\u00f6fgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anesthesia experiments on himself. It was first marketed in 1949.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nDosage forms: Lidocaine, usually in the form of its hydrochloride salt, is available in various forms including many topical formulations and solutions for injection or infusion.  It is also available as a transdermal patch, which is applied directly to the skin.\n\nNames: Lidocaine is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), and Australian Approved Name (AAN), while lignocaine is the former BAN and AAN. Both the old and new names will be displayed on the product label in Australia until at least 2023.\nXylocaine is a brand name, referring to the major synthetic building block 2,6-xylidine. The \"ligno\" prefix is chosen because \"xylo\" means wood in Greek while \"ligno\" means the same in Latin. The \"lido\" prefix instead refers to the fact that the drug is chemically related to acetanilide.\n\nRecreational use: As of 2021, lidocaine is not listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as a substance whose use is banned in sport. It is used as an adjuvant, adulterant, and diluent to street drugs such as cocaine and heroin. It is one of the three common ingredients in site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders.\n\nAdulterant in cocaine: Lidocaine is often added to cocaine as a diluent. Cocaine and lidocaine both numb the gums when applied. This gives the user the impression of high-quality cocaine when in actuality the user is receiving a diluted product.\n\nCompendial status: Japanese Pharmacopoeia 15\nUnited States Pharmacopeia 31\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \"Lidocaine Transdermal Patch\". MedlinePlus.\nUS patent 2441498, Nils Magnus Loefgren & Bengt Josef Lundqvist, \"Alkyl glycinanilides\", published 1948-05-11, issued 1948-05-11,  assigned to ASTRA APOTEKARNES KEM FAB\n\n\n pubchem:\nLidocaine is the monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of N,N-diethylglycine with 2,6-dimethylaniline. It has a role as a local anaesthetic, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a drug allergen. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a tertiary amino compound and a member of benzenes. It is functionally related to a glycinamide.\nEver since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation.  Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\nLidocaine is an Amide Local Anesthetic and Antiarrhythmic. The physiologic effect of lidocaine is by means of Local Anesthesia.\nLidocaine is a synthetic aminoethylamide with local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic properties. Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses and effecting local anesthesia.\nLIDOCAINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1948 and has 23 approved and 105 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA.\nLidocaine is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a local anesthetic and cardiac depressant used as an antiarrhythmia agent. Its actions are more intense and its effects more prolonged than those of procaine but its duration of action is shorter than that of bupivacaine or prilocaine. Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage gated sodium (Na+) channels in the neuronal cell membrane that are responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their birth in the first place.\nA local anesthetic and cardiac depressant used as an antiarrhythmia agent. Its actions are more intense and its effects more prolonged than those of PROCAINE but its duration of action is shorter than that of BUPIVACAINE or PRILOCAINE.\nSee also: Lidocaine Hydrochloride (has salt form); Lidocaine; Tetracaine (component of); Lidocaine tosylate (is active moiety of) ...

        "text1": "Title: Quinone\nwikipedia: The quinones are a class of organic compounds that are formally \"derived from aromatic compounds [such as benzene or naphthalene] by conversion of an even number of \u2013CH=  groups into \u2013C(=O)\u2013 groups with any necessary rearrangement of double bonds\", resulting in \"a fully conjugated cyclic dione structure\".\nThe archetypical member of the class is 1,4-benzoquinone or cyclohexadienedione, often called simply \"quinone\" (thus the name of the class). Other important examples are 1,2-benzoquinone (ortho-quinone), 1,4-naphthoquinone and 9,10-anthraquinone.\nThe name is derived from that of quinic acid (with the suffix \"-one\" indicating a ketone), since it is one of the compounds obtained upon oxidation of quinic acid. Quinic acid, like quinine is obtained from cinchona bark, called quinaquina in the indigenous languages of Peruvian tribes.\n\nProperties: Quinones are oxidized derivatives of aromatic compounds and are often readily made from reactive aromatic compounds with electron-donating substituents such as phenols and catechols, which increase the nucleophilicity of the ring and contributes to the large redox potential needed to break aromaticity. (Quinones are conjugated but not aromatic). Quinones are electrophilic Michael acceptors stabilised by conjugation. Depending on the quinone and the site of reduction, reduction can either rearomatise the compound or break the conjugation. Conjugate addition nearly always breaks the conjugation.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nThe term quinone is also used more generally for a large class of compounds formally derived from aromatic quinones through replacement of some hydrogen atoms by other atoms or radicals.\n\nReactions: Quinones form polymers by formation of hydrogen bonds with \u03c1-hydroquinone.\n\nReduction: Quinones are oxidizing agents, sometimes reversibly so. Relative to benzoquinone, more strongly oxidizing quinones include chloranil and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (also known as DDQ).\nThe oxidizing power of quinones is enhanced by the presence of acids. In acidic conditions, quinone undergoes two-electron and two-proton reduction to hydroquinone.\n\nIn alkaline conditions, quinones undergo a reversible single-step, two-electron reduction. In neutral conditions, quinones may undergo either a one-proton, two-electron reduction or a two-electron reduction.  In aprotic media, quinones undergo two-step reduction without protons. In the first step, a short-lived semiquinone intermediate is formed. In the second step, the semiquinone is reduced into a quinone dianion.\n9,10-Anthraquinone-2,7-disulphonic acid (AQDS) a quinone similar to one found naturally in rhubarb has been used as a charge carrier in metal-free flow batteries.\n\nAddition: Quinones undergo addition reaction to form 1,4-addition products. An example of 1,4-addition reaction is the addition of hydrogen chloride to form chlorohydroquinone:  \n\nQuinones can undergo Diels\u2013Alder reactions. The quinone acts as the dienophile and reacts with a diene at a carbon-carbon double bond.\nIn Diels\u2013Alder reactions quinones are used as dienophiles. Historically important syntheses include cholesterol, cortisone, morphine, and reserpine.\n\nOccurrence and uses: \n\nProduction of hydrogen peroxide: A large scale industrial application of quinones is for the production of hydrogen peroxide. 2-Alkylanthraquinones are hydrogenated to the corresponding hydroquinones (quinizarins), which then transfer H2 to oxygen:\n\ndihydroanthraquinone  +  O2   \u2192   anthraquinone  +  H2O2\nin this way, several million metric tons of H2O2 are produced annually.\n1,4-Naphthoquinone, derived by oxidation of naphthalene with chromium trioxide. It is the precursor to anthraquinone.\n\nBiochemistry: Numerous quinones are significant roles in biology.  Vitamin K, which is involved in coagulation of blood, is a quinone. Ubiquinone-10 is a naturally occurring 1,4-benzoquinone involved in respiration apparatus. Plastoquinone is a redox relay involved in photosynthesis.  Pyrroloquinoline quinone is another biological redox cofactor.\n\nQuinones are conjectured to occur in all respiring organisms. Some serve as electron acceptors in electron transport chains such as those in photosynthesis (plastoquinone, phylloquinone), and aerobic respiration (ubiquinone). Phylloquinone is also known as vitamin K1 as it is used by animals to carboxylate certain proteins, which are involved in blood coagulation, bone formation, and other processes. Conversely, the toxicity of paracetamol is due to its metabolism to a quinone imine, which then reacts with liver proteins to cause liver failure.\nThe auto-oxidation of the neurotransmitter dopamine and its precursor L-Dopa generates the comparatively stable dopamine quinone which inhibits the functioning of dopamine transporter (DAT) and the TH enzyme and leads to low mitochondrial ATP production.\nThe  benzoquinone blattellaquinone is a sex pheromone in cockroaches. In the spray of bombardier beetles, hydroquinone reacts with hydrogen peroxide to produce a fiery blast of steam, a deterrent in the animal world.\n\nMedical: Several quinones are of pharmacological interest.  They form a major class of anticancer cytotoxins.  One example is daunorubicin, which is antileukemic. Some of them show anti-tumoral activity. They embody some claims in herbal medicine. These applications include purgative (sennosides), antimicrobial and antiparasitic (rhein and saprorthoquinone, atovaquone), anti-tumor (emodin and juglone), inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis (arnebinone and arnebifuranone) and anti-cardiovascular disease (tanshinone).  Malbranchea cinnamomea is a thermophilic fungus, which produces a quinone antibiotic.\nAnother quinone-containing drug is Mecarbinate (dimecarbine), made by the reaction of ethyl N-methyl-\u03b2-aminocrotonate with para-benzoquinone. Others include Amendol, Oxyphemedol, Phemedol all in FR5142 (M) \u2015 1967-06-05. Note: These are all indoles made via the Nenitzescu indole synthesis. The antineoplastic Apaziquone.\nBenzoquinone compounds are a metabolite of paracetamol.\n\nDyes: Many natural and artificial coloring substances (dyes and pigments) are quinone derivatives, for instance lawsone is the active dye compound in henna. They are second only to azo dyes in importance as dyestuffs, with particular emphasis on blue colors. Alizarin (1,2-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone), extracted from the madder plant, was the first natural dye to be synthesized from coal tar.\n\nPhotography: A commercial application of quinones is in black-and-white photography. Black-and-white film is covered with an emulsion containing silver bromide or silver iodide crystals, which exposure to light activates. Hydroquinone is used to reduce the activated silver ions to metallic silver. During this process, hydroquinone is oxidized to quinone. All silver halide not activated by light or reduced by hydroquinone is removed, leaving a negative by deposited silver where the film had been struck by light.\n\nNomenclature: Quinones are commonly named with a prefix that indicates the parent aromatic hydrocarbon (\"benzo-\" for benzene, \"naphtho-\" for naphthalene, \"anthra-\" for anthracene, etc.) and the \"-quinone\" suffix. Infix multipliers \"-di-\", \"-tri-\", \"-tetra-\" (etc.) are used when there are 4, 6, 8 (etc.) carbonyls. The position of the carbonyl groups can be indicated before the prefix (as in \"1,4,5,8-naphthodiquinone\") or after it (\"anthra-1,4-quinone\").\n\nStructural analogues of quinones: Quinone methide \u2013  where one O is replaced by C\nXylylene \u2013  where both O's are replaced by C's\nQuinone imine \u2013  where one O is replaced by N, illustrated by NAPQI\nQuinone diimine \u2013  where both O's are replaced by N's, illustrated by the antiseptic ambazone\nAzaxylylene \u2013  where both O's are replaced by one N and one C, illustrated by various fuchsine dyes like pararosaniline\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Quinones at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\n\n\n pubchem:\nBenzoquinone appears as a yellowish-colored crystalline solid with a pungent, irritating odor.

Acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of quinone, via inhalation in humans, results in irritation of the eyes, consisting of discoloration of the conjunctiva and cornea, and causes dermatitis from dermal exposure. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to quinone in humans may result in visual disturbances, and chronic dermal contact causes skin ulceration. No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of quinone in humans. The results of available animal studies are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of quinone. EPA has not evaluated quinone for carcinogenicity.\n1,4-Benzoquinone has been reported in Blaps lethifera, Uloma tenebrionoides, and other organisms with data available.\nQuinone is also called 1,4-benzoquinone or cyclohexadienedione.

        "text2": "Title: Anthracene\nwikipedia: Anthracene is a solid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) of formula C14H10, consisting of three fused benzene rings. It is a component of coal tar. Anthracene is used in the production of the red dye alizarin and other dyes. Anthracene is colorless but exhibits a blue (400\u2013500 nm peak) fluorescence under ultraviolet radiation.\n\nHistory and etymology: Crude anthracene (with a melting point of only 180\u00b0) was discovered in 1832 by Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Auguste Laurent who crystalized it from a fraction of coal tar later known as \"anthracene oil\". Since their (inaccurate) measurements showed the proportions of carbon and hydrogen of it to be the same as in naphthalene, Laurent called it paranaphtaline in his 1835 publication of the discovery, which is translated to English as paranaphthalene. Two years later, however, he decided to rename the compound to its modern name derived from Ancient Greek: \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03b1\u03be, romanized: anthrax, lit.\u2009'coal' because after discovering other polyaromatic hydrocarbons he decided it was only one of isomers of naphthalene. This notion was disproved in 1850s and 1860s.\n\nOccurrence and production: Coal tar, which contains around 1.5% anthracene, remains a major source of this material.  Common impurities are phenanthrene and carbazole. The mineral form of anthracene is called freitalite and is related to a coal deposit. A classic laboratory method for the preparation of anthracene is by cyclodehydration of o-methyl- or o-methylene-substituted diarylketones in the so-called Elbs reaction, for example from o-tolyl phenyl ketone.\n\nReactions: \n\nReduction: Reduction of anthracene with alkali metals yields the deeply colored radical anion salts M+[anthracene]\u2212 (M = Li, Na, K).   Hydrogenation gives 9,10-dihydroanthracene, preserving the aromaticity of the two flanking rings.\n\nCycloadditions: In any solvent except water, anthracene photodimerizes by the action of UV light:\n\nThe dimer, called dianthracene (or sometimes paranthracene), is connected by a pair of new carbon-carbon bonds, the result of the [4+4] cycloaddition. It reverts to anthracene thermally or with UV irradiation below 300 nm. Substituted anthracene derivatives behave similarly. The reaction is affected by the presence of oxygen.\nAnthracene also reacts with dienophile singlet oxygen in a [4+2]-cycloaddition (Diels\u2013Alder reaction):\n\nWith electrophiles: Chemical oxidation occurs readily, giving anthraquinone, C14H8O2 (below), for example using hydrogen peroxide and vanadyl acetylacetonate.\n\nElectrophilic substitution of anthracene occurs at the 9 position.  For example, formylation affords 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde.  Substitution at other positions is effected indirectly, for example starting with anthroquinone.  Bromination of anthracene gives 9,10-dibromoanthracene.\n\nUses: Anthracene is converted mainly to anthraquinone, a precursor to dyes.\n\nNiche: Anthracene, a wide band-gap organic semiconductor is used as a scintillator for detectors of high-energy photons, electrons and alpha particles.  Plastics, such as polyvinyltoluene, can be doped with anthracene to produce a plastic scintillator that is approximately water-equivalent for use in radiation therapy dosimetry.  Anthracene's emission spectrum peaks at between 400 nm and 440 nm.\nIt is also used in wood preservatives, insecticides, and coating materials.\nAnthracene is commonly used as a UV tracer in conformal coatings applied to printed wiring boards.  The anthracene tracer allows the conformal coating to be inspected under UV light.\n\nDerivatives: A variety of anthracene derivatives find specialized uses.  Derivatives having a hydroxyl group are 1-hydroxyanthracene and 2-hydroxyanthracene, homologous to phenol and naphthols, and hydroxyanthracene (also called anthrol, and anthracenol) are pharmacologically active.  \nAnthracene may also be found with multiple hydroxyl groups, as in 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene.\nSome anthracene derivatives are used as pharmaceutical drugs, including bisantrene, trazitiline, and benzoctamine.\n\nOccurrence: Anthracene, as many other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is generated during combustion processes. Exposure to humans happens mainly through tobacco smoke and ingestion of food contaminated with combustion products.\n\nToxicology: Many investigations indicate that anthracene is noncarcinogenic: \"consistently negative findings in numerous in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests\". Early experiments suggested otherwise because crude samples were contaminated with other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  Furthermore, it is readily biodegraded in soil.  It is especially susceptible to degradation in the presence of light.\n\nSee also: 9,10-Dithioanthracene, derivative with two thiol groups added to the central ring\nPhenanthrene\nTetracene\n\nReferences: \n\nCited sources: Haynes, William M., ed.

        "text1": "Title: Amisulpride\nwikipedia: Amisulpride, sold under the brand names Solian and Barhemsys, is a medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, acute psychotic episodes, depression, and nausea and vomiting. It is specifically used at lower doses intravenously to prevent and treat postoperative nausea and vomiting; at low doses by mouth to treat depression; and at higher doses by mouth to treat psychosis.\nIt is usually classed with the atypical antipsychotics. Chemically it is a benzamide and like other benzamide antipsychotics, such as sulpiride, it is associated with a high risk of elevating blood levels of the lactation hormone, prolactin (thereby potentially causing the absence of the menstrual cycle, breast enlargement, even in males, breast milk secretion not related to breastfeeding, impaired fertility, impotence, breast pain, etc.), and a low risk, relative to the typical antipsychotics, of causing movement disorders.\nAmisulpride is indicated for use in the United States in adults for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class; and to treat PONV in those who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or have not received prophylaxis.\nAmisulpride is believed to work by blocking, or antagonizing, the dopamine D2 receptor, reducing its signalling. The effectiveness of amisulpride in treating dysthymia and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is believed to stem from its blockade of the presynaptic dopamine D2 and D3 autoreceptors. These presynaptic receptors regulate the release of dopamine into the synapse, so by blocking them amisulpride increases dopamine concentrations in the synapse. This increased dopamine concentration is theorized to act on dopamine D1 receptors to relieve depressive symptoms (in dysthymia) and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.\nIt was introduced by Sanofi-Aventis in the 1990s. Its patent expired by 2008, and generic formulations became available. It is marketed in all English-speaking countries except for Canada.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nSchizophrenia: Although according to other studies it appears to have comparable efficacy to olanzapine in the treatment of schizophrenia, amisulpride augmentation, similarly to sulpiride augmentation, has been considered a viable treatment option (although this is based on low-quality evidence) in clozapine-resistant cases of schizophrenia. Another recent study concluded that amisulpride is an appropriate first-line treatment for the management of acute psychosis.\n\nDepression: Amisulpride is approved and used at low doses in the treatment of dysthymia and major depressive disorder. Whereas typical doses used in schizophrenia block postsynaptic dopamine D2-like receptors and reduce dopaminergic neurotransmission, low doses of amisulpride preferentially block presynaptic dopamine D2 and D3 autoreceptors and thereby disinhibit dopamine release and enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission. A 2010 Cochrane review found that low-dose amisulpride was effective in the treatment of dysthymia. Likewise, a 2024 literature review found that low-dose amisulpride was effective for dysthymia. The drug is approved for depression specifically in Italy, Greece, and certain other European countries.\n\nPostoperative nausea and vomiting: Amisulpride is indicated for use in the United States in adults for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), either alone or in combination with an antiemetic of a different class; and to treat PONV in those who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or have not received prophylaxis.\n\nAvailable forms: Amisulpride is available in the form of 100, 200, and 400 mg oral tablets. In the United States, it is available in the form of a 5 mg/2 mL (2.5 mg/mL) solution for intravenous administration.\n\nContraindications: Amisulpride's use is contraindicated in the following disease states and populations\n\nPheochromocytoma\nConcomitant prolactin-dependent tumours e.g. prolactinoma, breast cancer\nMovement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies)\nLactation\nChildren before the onset of puberty\nNeither is it recommended to use amisulpride in patients with hypersensitivities to amisulpride or the excipients found in its dosage form.\n\nAdverse effects: Very Common (\u226510% incidence)\nExtrapyramidal side effects (EPS; including dystonia, tremor, akathisia, parkinsonism).\nCommon (\u22651%, <10% incidence)\n\nHyperprolactinaemia (which can lead to galactorrhoea, breast enlargement and tenderness, sexual dysfunction, etc.)\nWeight gain (produces less weight gain than chlorpromazine, clozapine, iloperidone, olanzapine, paliperidone, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, zotepine and more (although not statistically significantly) weight gain than haloperidol, lurasidone, ziprasidone and approximately as much weight gain as aripiprazole and asenapine)\nAnticholinergic side effects (although it does not bind to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and hence these side effects are usually quite mild) such as\n- constipation\n- dry mouth\n- disorder of accommodation\n- Blurred vision\nRare (<1% incidence)\n\nBlood dyscrasias such as leucopenia, neutropenia and agranulocytosis\nQT interval prolongation (in a recent meta-analysis of the safety and efficacy of 15 antipsychotic drugs amisulpride was found to have the 2nd highest effect size for causing QT interval prolongation)\nHyperprolactinaemia results from antagonism of the D2 receptors located on the lactotrophic cells found in the anterior pituitary gland. Amisulpride has a high propensity for elevating plasma prolactin levels as a result of its poor blood\u2013brain barrier penetrability and hence the resulting greater ratio of peripheral D2 occupancy to central D2 occupancy. This means that to achieve the sufficient occupancy (~60\u201380%) of the central D2 receptors in order to elicit its therapeutic effects a dose must be given that is enough to saturate peripheral D2 receptors including those in the anterior pituitary.\n\nDiscontinuation: The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.\nThere is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.\n\nOverdose: Torsades de pointes is common in overdose. Amisulpride is moderately dangerous in overdose (with the TCAs being very dangerous and the SSRIs being modestly dangerous).\n\nInteractions: Amisulpride should not be used in conjunction with drugs that prolong the QT interval (such as citalopram, bupropion, clozapine, tricyclic antidepressants, sertindole, ziprasidone, etc.), reduce heart rate and those that can induce hypokalaemia. Likewise it is imprudent to combine antipsychotics due to the additive risk for tardive dyskinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Amisulpride functions primarily as a dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It has high affinity for these receptors with dissociation constants of 3.0 and 3.5 nM, respectively. Although standard doses used to treat psychosis inhibit dopaminergic neurotransmission, low doses preferentially block inhibitory presynaptic autoreceptors. This results in a facilitation of dopamine activity, and for this reason, low-dose amisulpride has also been used to treat dysthymia.\nAmisulpride and its relatives sulpiride, levosulpiride, and sultopride have been shown to bind to the high-affinity GHB receptor at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant (IC50Tooltip Half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 50 nM for amisulpride).\nAmisulpride, sultopride and sulpiride respectively present decreasing in vitro affinities for the D2 receptor (IC50 = 27, 120 and 181 nM) and the D3 receptor (IC50 = 3.6, 4.8 and 17.5 nM).\nThough it was long widely assumed that dopaminergic modulation is solely responsible for the respective antidepressant and antipsychotic properties of amisulpride, it was subsequently found that the drug also acts as a potent antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (Ki = 11.5 nM). Several of the other atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and ziprasidone are potent antagonists at the 5-HT7 receptor as well, and selective antagonists of the receptor show antidepressant properties themselves. To characterize the role of the 5-HT7 receptor in the antidepressant effects of amisulpride, a study prepared 5-HT7 receptor knockout mice. The study found that in two widely used rodent models of depression, the tail suspension test, and the forced swim test, those mice did not exhibit an antidepressant response upon treatment with amisulpride. These results suggest that 5-HT7 receptor antagonism mediates the antidepressant effects of amisulpride.\nAmisulpride also appears to bind with high affinity to the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor (Ki = 13 nM), where it acts as an antagonist. The clinical implications of this, if any, are unclear. In any case, there is no evidence that this action mediates any of the therapeutic effects of amisulpride.\nAmisulpride shows stereoselectivity in its actions. Aramisulpride ((R)-amisulpride) has higher affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor (Ki = 47 nM vs. 1,900 nM) while esamisulpride ((S)-amisulpride) has higher affinity for the D2 receptor (4.0 nM vs. 140 nM).\nThrough a high direct unmetabolized excretion, it has, despite its high usual dose, also high affinity for dopamine-D2-D3-receptors. Also the available literature gives us hints about also relatively high receptor dissociation kinetics (through a delayed but high occupancy at dopamine receptors after 6 hours from a 100 mg exposure). Moreover, this dopamine exposure could be slightly more \"balanced\" providing some little advantages over haloperidol in using it for drug exposure. Due to its lack of compensatory serotonin effects and also not having an anticholinergic profile, it may not considered as an effective alternative if akathasia is a problem.\n\nPharmacokinetics: The oral bioavailability of amisulpride is 48%. Its plasma protein binding is 16%. The drug is metabolized by the liver but its metabolism is minimal. Its elimination half-life is 12 hours. Amisulpride is eliminated in urine (23\u201346%) and feces and is excreted mostly unchanged.\n\nChemistry: Amisulpride is a benzamide derivative. It is structurally related to other benzamide dopamine receptor antagonists employed as antipsychotics and antiemetics including levosulpiride, metoclopramide, nemonapride, remoxipride, sulpiride, sultopride, tiapride, and veralipride. Chemically, it is also known as aminosultopride, differing from sultopride only in possessing an amino substituent on its benzene ring.\n\nHistory: Amisulpride was introduced by Sanofi-Aventis in the 1990s. Its patent expired by 2008, and generic formulations became available.\n\nUnited States clinical development: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a 10 mg/4mL amisulpride IV formulation for use in post-operative nausea based on evidence from four clinical trials of 2323 subjects undergoing surgery or experiencing nausea and vomiting after the surgery. The trials were conducted at 80 sites in the United States, Canada and Europe.\nTwo trials (Trials 1 and 2) enrolled subjects scheduled to have surgery. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either amisulpride or a placebo drug at the beginning of general anesthesia. In Trial 1, subjects received amisulpride or placebo alone, and in Trial 2, they received amisulpride or placebo in combination with one medication approved for prevention of nausea and vomiting. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was complete.\nThe trials counted the number of subjects who had no vomiting and did not use additional medications for nausea or vomiting in the first day (24 hours) after the surgery. The results then compared amisulpride to placebo.\nThe other two trials (Trials 3 and 4) enrolled subjects who were experiencing nausea and vomiting after surgery. In Trial 3, subjects did not receive any medication to prevent nausea and vomiting before surgery and in Trial 4 they received the medication, but the treatment did not work. In both trials, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either amisulpride or placebo. Neither the subjects nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was complete.\nThe trials counted the number of subjects who had no vomiting and did not use additional medications for nausea or vomiting in the first day (24 hours) after the treatment. The trial compared amisulpride to placebo.\nThe FDA has not approved amisulpride for use in any psychiatric indication.

It is a potent, selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist. It is an atypical antipsychotic/antischizophrenic agent with limited extrapyrimidal side effects. It has a role as a second generation antipsychotic, a xenobiotic and an environmental contaminant. It is a member of pyrrolidines, an aromatic amine, a sulfone, a member of benzamides and an aromatic amide.\nAmisulpride is a benzamide derivative and a dopamine receptor antagonist that selectively works on dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. As an antipsychotic agent, amisulpride alleviates both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and it exhibits antidepressant properties in patients with psychiatric disorders, dysthymia, and major depression. Amisulpride predominantly works in the limbic system, which explains its relatively lower risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects compared to other atypical antipsychotic agents. Oral tablets of amisulpride is used in European countries as a treatment for acute and chronic schizophrenic disorders, as well as secondary negative symptoms in mental health disorders such as affective disorders, depressive mood, and mental retardation.  Amisulpride is also used as an antiemetic agent. In the US, the intravenous formulation of amisulpride is used to treat and prevent postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults, either as monotherapy or in combination with another antiemetic agent of a different drug class. It is marketed under the brand name Barhemsys.\nAmisulpride is a Dopamine-2 Receptor Antagonist. The mechanism of action of amisulpride is as a Dopamine D2 Antagonist.\nAmisulpride is an intravenously administered dopamine receptor 2 antagonist used for the prevention and therapy of postoperative nausea and vomiting.

        "text2": "Title: Zotepine\nwikipedia: Zotepine is an atypical antipsychotic drug indicated for acute and chronic schizophrenia. It has been used in Germany since 1990 (although it has been discontinued in Germany) and Japan since 1982.\nZotepine is not approved for use in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada or New Zealand.\n\nMedical uses: Zotepine's primary use is as a treatment for schizophrenia although clinical trials have been conducted (with positive results) into its efficacy as an antimanic agent in patients with acute bipolar mania. In a 2013 study in a comparison of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectivity in treating schizophrenic symptoms, zotepine demonstrated medium-strong effectivity. Less effective than clozapine, slightly less effective than olanzapine and risperidone, approximately as effective as paliperidone, and slightly more effective than haloperidol, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.\n\nSide effects: Common\n\nUnknown frequency\n\nRare\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: The antipsychotic effect of zotepine is thought to be mediated through antagonist activity at dopamine and serotonin receptors. Zotepine has a high affinity for the D1 and D2 receptors. It also affects the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. In addition, its active metabolite, norzotepine, serves as a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.\n\nSynthesis: The reaction of 2-chloroacetophenone with 4-chlorothiophenol gives a thioether. This is treated with morpholine and sulfur in a Willgerodt\u2013Kindler reaction to give a phenylacetic acid derivative after acid hydrolysis of the amide intermediate. Cyclization of this compound in the presence of polyphosphoric acid forms the dibenzothiepin ring system of the drug. The enol ether, zotepine, is produced when this is treated with the chloroethyl amine and potassium carbonate in methyl isobutyl ketone as solvent.
