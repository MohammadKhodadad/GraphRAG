        "text1": "Title: Pyridazine\nwikipedia: Pyridazine is an aromatic, heterocyclic, organic compound with the molecular formula C4H4N2. It contains a six-membered ring with two adjacent nitrogen atoms. It is a colorless liquid with a boiling point of 208 \u00b0C. It is isomeric with two other diazine (C4H4N2) rings, pyrimidine and pyrazine.\n\nOccurrence: Pyridazines are rare in nature, possibly reflecting the scarcity of naturally occurring hydrazines, common building blocks for the synthesis of these heterocycles. The pyridazine structure is a popular pharmacophore which is found within a number of herbicides such as credazine, pyridafol and pyridate. It is also found within the structure of several drugs such as cefozopran, cadralazine, minaprine, pipofezine, and hydralazine.\n\nSynthesis: In the course of his classic investigation on the Fischer indole synthesis, Emil Fischer prepared the first pyridazine via the condensation of phenylhydrazine and levulinic acid. The parent heterocycle was first prepared by oxidation of benzocinnoline to the pyridazinetetracarboxylic acid followed by decarboxylation. A better route to this otherwise esoteric compound starts with the maleic hydrazide. These heterocycles are often prepared via condensation of 1,4-diketones or 4-ketoacids with hydrazines.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nPyridazine is a member of pyridazines and a diazine.\nsafety: Irritant\nsmiles: C1=CC=NN=C1\nforumla: C4H4N2\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 80.09 g/mol\nXLogP3: -0.7\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 0\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 2\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\nExact Mass: 80.037448136 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 80.037448136 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 25.8\nHeavy Atom Count: 6\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 30.5\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text1": "Title: Indole-3-acetic acid\nwikipedia: Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 3-IAA) is the most common naturally occurring plant hormone of the auxin class. It is the best known of the auxins, and has been the subject of extensive studies by plant physiologists. IAA is a derivative of indole, containing a carboxymethyl substituent. It is a colorless solid that is soluble in polar organic solvents.\n\nBiosynthesis: IAA is predominantly produced in cells of the apex (bud) and very young leaves of a plant. Plants can synthesize IAA by several independent biosynthetic pathways.  Four of them start from tryptophan, but there is also a biosynthetic pathway independent of tryptophan.  Plants mainly produce IAA from tryptophan through indole-3-pyruvic acid. IAA is also produced from tryptophan through indole-3-acetaldoxime in Arabidopsis thaliana.\nIn rats, IAA is a product of both endogenous and colonic microbial metabolism from dietary tryptophan along with tryptophol. This was first observed in rats infected by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. A 2015 experiment showed that a high-tryptophan diet can decrease serum levels of IAA in mice, but that in humans, protein consumption has no reliably predictable effect on plasma IAA levels. Human cells have been known to produce IAA in vitro since the 1950s, and the critical biosynthesis gene IL4I1 has been identified.\n\nBiological effects: As all auxins, IAA has many different effects, such as inducing cell elongation and cell division with all subsequent results for plant growth and development. On a larger scale, IAA serves as signaling molecule necessary for development of plant organs and coordination of growth.\n\nPlant gene regulation: IAA enters the plant cell nucleus and binds to a protein complex composed of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3), resulting in  ubiquitination of Aux/IAA proteins with increased speed. Aux/IAA proteins bind to auxin response factor (ARF) proteins, forming a heterodimer, suppressing ARF activity. In 1997 it was described how ARFs bind to auxin-response gene elements in promoters of auxin regulated genes, generally activating transcription of that gene when an Aux/IAA protein is not bound.\nIAA inhibits the photorespiratory-dependent cell death in photorespiratory catalase  mutants. This suggests a role for auxin signalling in stress tolerance.\n\nBacterial physiology: IAA production is widespread among environmental bacteria that inhabit soils, waters, but also plant and animal hosts. Distribution and substrate specificity of the involved enzymes suggests these pathways play a role beyond plant-microbe interactions. Enterobacter cloacae can produce IAA, from aromatic and branched-chain amino acids.\n\nFungal symbiosis: Fungi can form a fungal mantle around roots of perennial plants called ectomycorrhiza. A fungus specific to spruce called Tricholoma vaccinum was shown to produce IAA from tryptophan and excrete it from its hyphae. This induced branching in cultures, and enhanced Hartig net formation. The fungus uses a multidrug and toxic extrusion (MATE) transporter Mte1. Research into IAA-producing fungi to promote plant growth and protection in sustainable agriculture is underway.\n\nSkatole biosynthesis: Skatole, the odorant in feces, is produced from tryptophan via indoleacetic acid. Decarboxylation gives the methylindole.\n\nSynthesis: Chemically, it can be synthesized by the reaction of indole with glycolic acid in the presence of base at 250 \u00b0C:\n\nAlternatively the compound has been synthesized by Fischer indole synthesis using glutamic acid and phenylhydrazine. Glutamic acid was converted to the necessary aldehyde via Strecker degradation.\nMany methods for its synthesis have been developed since its original synthesis from indole-3-acetonitrile.\n\nHistory and synthetic analogs: William Gladstone Tempelman studied substances for growth promotion at Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. After 7 years of research he changed the direction of his study to try the same substances at high concentrations in order to stop plant growth. In 1940 he published his finding that IAA killed broadleaf plants within a cereal field.\nThe search for an acid with a longer half life, i.e. a metabolically and environmentally more stable compound led to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), both phenoxy herbicides and analogs of IAA. Robert Pokorny an industrial chemist for the C.B. Dolge Company in Westport, Connecticut published their synthesis in 1941. When sprayed on broad-leaf dicot plants, they induce rapid, uncontrolled growth, eventually killing them. First introduced in 1946, these herbicides were in widespread use in agriculture by the middle of the 1950s.\nOther less expensive synthetic auxin analogs on the market for use in horticulture are indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).\n\nMammalian toxicity/health effects: Little research has been conducted on the effects of IAA on humans and toxicity data are limited. No data on human carcinogenic, teratogenic, or developmental effects have been created. \nIAA is listed in its MSDS as mutagenic to mammalian somatic cells, and possibly carcinogenic based on animal data. It may cause adverse reproductive effects (fetotoxicity) and birth defects based on animal data. No human data as of 2008. It is listed as a potential skin, eye, and respiratory irritant, and users are warned not to ingest it. Protocols for ingestion, inhalation, and skin/eye exposure are standard for moderately poisonous compounds and include thorough rinsing in the case of skin and eyes, fresh air in the case of inhalation, and immediately contacting a physician in all cases to determine the best course of action and not to induce vomiting when of ingested. The NFPA 704 health hazard rating for IAA is 2, which denotes a risk of temporary incapacitation with intense or prolonged, but not chronic exposure, and a possibility of residual injury. IAA is a direct ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and IAA treatment of mice indicate liver-protective effects in a model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Humans typically have relatively high levels of IAA in their serum (~1 \u03bcM), but this can be increased further in certain disease conditions and can be a poor prognostic marker for cardiovascular health. Whether this IAA originates from endogenous biosynthesis via IL4I1 or gut microbiota is unknown. A 2021 study found that normal mice had an average of 3.7 times as much IAA in their feces compared to germ-free mice, suggesting that the mammalian microbiome contributes significantly to the overall circulating amount.\n\nDevelopmental toxicity: IAA produces microcephaly in rats during the early stage of cerebral cortex development. IAA treatment of pregnant rats, at a dose of 1 gram per kg of body weight per day, decreased the locomotor activities of rat embryos/fetuses; treatment with IAA and analog 1(methyl)-IAA resulted in apoptosis of neuroepithelial cell and significantly decreased brain sizes relative to body weight in embryonic rats.\n\nImmunotoxin: IAA is an apoptosis-inducing ligand in mammals. As of 2010, the signal transduction pathways are as follows: IAA/HRP activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases.  It induces caspase-8 and caspase-9, which results in caspase-3 activation and poly(adp-ribose) polymerases cleavage. \nIn 2002 it had been hypothesized that IAA coupled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) could be used in targeted cancer therapy. Radical-IAA molecules would attach to cells marked by HRP and HRP reactive cells would be selectively killed. In 2010 in vitro experiments proved this concept of IAA as an immunotoxin when used in preclinical studies of targeted cancer therapy, as it induced apoptosis in bladder and in hematological malignancies.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nIndole-3-acetic acid is a monocarboxylic acid that is acetic acid in which one of the methyl hydrogens has been replaced by a 1H-indol-3-yl group.

Uremic toxins can be subdivided into three major groups based upon their chemical and physical characteristics: 1) small, water-soluble, non-protein-bound compounds, such as urea; 2) small, lipid-soluble and/or protein-bound compounds, such as the phenols and 3) larger so-called middle-molecules, such as beta2-microglobulin. Chronic exposure of uremic toxins can lead to a number of conditions including renal damage, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.\n\nIndoleacetic acid (IAA) is a breakdown product of tryptophan metabolism and is often produced by the action of bacteria in the mammalian gut. Some endogenous production of IAA in mammalian tissues also occurs. It may be produced by the decarboxylation of tryptamine or the oxidative deamination of tryptophan. IAA frequently occurs at low levels in urine and has been found in elevated levels in the urine of patients with phenylketonuria ( Using material extracted from human urine, it was discovered by Kogl in 1933 that Indoleacetic acid is also an important plant hormone Specifically IAA is a member of the group of phytohormones called auxins. IAA is generally considered to be the most important native auxin. Plant cells synthesize IAA from tryptophan. IAA and some derivatives can be oxidised by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to cytotoxic species. IAA is only toxic after oxidative decarboxylation; the effect of IAA/HRP is thought to be due in part to the formation of methylene-oxindole, which may conjugate with DNA bases and protein thiols. IAA/HRP could be used as the basis for targeted cancer therapy involving antibody-, polymer-, or gene-directed approaches, a potential new role for plant auxins in cancer therapy.

        "text2": "Title: Isoniazid\nwikipedia: Isoniazid, also known as isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH), is an antibiotic used for the treatment of tuberculosis. For active tuberculosis, it is often used together with rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. For latent tuberculosis, it is often used alone. It may also be used for atypical types of mycobacteria, such as M. avium, M. kansasii, and M. xenopi. It is usually taken by mouth, but may be used by injection into muscle.\n\nHistory: First synthesis was described in 1912. A. Kachugin invented the drug against tuberculosis under name Tubazid in 1949. Three pharmaceutical companies unsuccessfully attempted to patent the drug at the same time, the most prominent one being Roche, which launched its version, Rimifon, in 1952. \nThe drug was first tested at Many Farms, a Navajo community in Arizona, due to the Navajo reservation's tuberculosis problem and because the population had not previously been treated with streptomycin, the main tuberculosis treatment at the time. The research was led by Walsh McDermott, an infectious disease researcher with an interest in public health, who had previously taken isoniazid to treat his own tuberculosis.\nIsoniazid and a related drug, iproniazid, were among the first drugs to be referred to as antidepressants. Psychiatric use stopped in 1961 following reports of hepatotoxicity. Use against tuberculosis continued, as isoniazid's effectiveness against the disease outweighs its risks.\nIt is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies isoniazid as critically important for human medicine. Isoniazid is available as a generic medication.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nTuberculosis: Isoniazid is often used to treat latent and active tuberculosis infections. In persons with isoniazid-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid are usually effective when persons adhere to the prescribed treatment. However, in persons with isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid have a high rate of failure.\nIsoniazid has been approved as prophylactic therapy for the following populations:\n\nPeople with HIV infection and a PPD (purified protein derivative) reaction of at least 5 mm induration\nContacts of people with tuberculosis and who have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration\nPeople whose PPD reactions convert from negative to positive in a two-year period \u2013 at least 10 mm induration for those up to 35 years of age, and at least 15 mm induration for those at least 35 years old\nPeople with pulmonary damage on their chest X-ray that is likely to be due to healed tuberculosis and also have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration\nInjection drug users whose HIV status is negative who have a PPD reaction at least 10 mm induration\nPeople with a PPD of greater than or equal to 10 mm induration who are foreign-born from high prevalence geographical regions, low-income populations, and patients residing in long-term facilities\nIsoniazid can be used alone or in combination with Rifampin for treatment of latent tuberculosis, or as part of a four-drug regimen for treatment of active tuberculosis. The drug regimen typically requires daily or weekly oral administration for a period of three to nine months, often under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) supervision.\n\nNon-tuberculous mycobacteria: Isoniazid was widely used in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex as part of a regimen including rifampicin and ethambutol. Evidence suggests that isoniazid prevents mycolic acid synthesis in M. avium complex as in M. tuberculosis and although this is not bactericidal to M. avium complex, it greatly potentiates the effect of rifampicin. The introduction of macrolides led to this use greatly decreasing. However, since rifampicin is broadly underdosed in M. avium complex treatment, this effect may be worth re-investigating.\n\nSpecial populations: It is recommended that women with active tuberculosis who are pregnant or breastfeeding take isoniazid. Preventive therapy should be delayed until after giving birth. Nursing mothers excrete a relatively low and non-toxic concentration of INH in breast milk, and their babies are at low risk for side effects. Both pregnant women and infants being breastfed by mothers taking INH should take vitamin B6 in its pyridoxine form to minimize the risk of peripheral nerve damage.\nVitamin B6 is used to prevent isoniazid-induced B6 deficiency and neuropathy in people with a risk factor, such as pregnancy, lactation, HIV infection, alcoholism, diabetes, kidney failure, or malnutrition.\nPeople with liver dysfunction are at a higher risk for hepatitis caused by INH, and may need a lower dose.\nLevels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH.\n\nSide effects: Up to 20% of people taking isoniazid experience peripheral neuropathy when taking daily doses of 6 mg/kg of body weight or higher. Gastrointestinal reactions include nausea and vomiting. Aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis due to lack of production of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells by the bone marrow respectively, can also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions are also common and can present with a maculopapular rash and fever. Gynecomastia may occur.\nAsymptomatic elevation of serum liver enzyme concentrations occurs in 10% to 20% of people taking INH, and liver enzyme concentrations usually return to normal even when treatment is continued. Isoniazid has a boxed warning for severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis, which is age-dependent at a rate of 0.3% in people 21 to 35 years old and over 2% in those over age 50. Symptoms suggestive of liver toxicity include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, and loss of appetite. Black and Hispanic women are at higher risk for isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. When it happens, isoniazid-induced liver toxicity has been shown to occur in 50% of patients within the first 2 months of therapy.\nSome recommend that liver function should be monitored carefully in all people receiving it, but others recommend monitoring only in certain populations.\nHeadache, poor concentration, weight gain, poor memory, insomnia, and depression have all been associated with isoniazid use. All patients and healthcare workers should be aware of these serious side effects, especially if suicidal ideation or behavior are suspected.\nIsoniazid is associated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency because of its similar structure. Isoniazid is also associated with increased excretion of pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of pyridoxine) is required for \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Therefore, isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency causes insufficient heme formation in early red blood cells, leading to sideroblastic anemia.\nIsoniazid was found to significantly elevate the in vivo concentration of GABA and homocarnosine in a single subject via magnetic resonance spectroscopy.\n\nDrug interactions: People taking isoniazid and acetaminophen are at risk of acetaminophen toxicity. Isoniazid is thought to induce a liver enzyme which causes a larger amount of acetaminophen to be metabolized to a toxic form.\nIsoniazid decreases the metabolism of carbamazepine, thus slowing down its clearance from the body. People taking carbamazepine should have their carbamazepine levels monitored and, if necessary, have their dose adjusted accordingly.\nIt is possible that isoniazid may decrease the serum levels of ketoconazole after long-term treatment. This is seen with the simultaneous use of rifampin, isoniazid, and ketoconazole.\nIsoniazid may increase the amount of phenytoin in the body. The doses of phenytoin may need to be adjusted when given with isoniazid.\nIsoniazid may increase the plasma levels of theophylline. There are some cases of theophylline slowing down isoniazid elimination. Both theophylline and isoniazid levels should be monitored.\nValproate levels may increase when taken with isoniazid. Valproate levels should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary.\n\nMechanism of action: Isoniazid is a prodrug that inhibits the formation of the mycobacterial cell wall. Isoniazid must be activated by KatG, a bacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. KatG catalyzes the formation of the isonicotinic acyl radical, which spontaneously couples with NADH to form the nicotinoyl-NAD adduct. This complex binds tightly to the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of fatty acid synthase. This process inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are required components of the mycobacterial cell wall. A range of radicals are produced by KatG activation of isoniazid, including nitric oxide, which has also been shown to be important in the action of another antimycobacterial prodrug pretomanid.\n\nIsoniazid is bactericidal to rapidly dividing mycobacteria, but is bacteriostatic if the mycobacteria are slow-growing. It inhibits the cytochrome P450 system and hence acts as a source of free radicals.\nIsoniazid is a mild non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I). It inhibits diamine oxidase more strongly. These two actions are possible explanations for its antidepressant action as well as its ability to cause mania.\n\nMetabolism: Isoniazid reaches therapeutic concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and within caseous granulomas. It is metabolized in the liver via acetylation into acetylhydrazine. Two forms of the enzyme are responsible for acetylation, so some patients metabolize the drug more quickly than others. Hence, the half-life is bimodal, with \"slow acetylators\" and \"fast acetylators\". A graph of number of people versus time shows peaks at one and three hours. The height of the peaks depends on the ethnicities of the people being tested. The metabolites are excreted in the urine. Doses do not usually have to be adjusted in case of renal failure.\n\nPreparation: Isoniazid is an isonicotinic acid derivative. It is manufactured using 4-cyanopyridine and hydrazine hydrate. In another method, isoniazid was claimed to have been made from citric acid starting material.\nIt can in theory be made from methyl isonicotinate, which is labelled a semiochemical.\n\nBrand names: Hydra, Hyzyd, Isovit, Laniazid, Nydrazid, Rimifon, and Stanozide.\n\nOther uses: \n\nChromatography: Isonicotinic acid hydrazide is also used in chromatography to differentiate between various degrees of conjugation in organic compounds barring the ketone functional group. The test works by forming a hydrazone which can be detected by its bathochromic shift.\n\nDogs: Isoniazid may be used for dogs, but there have been concerns it can cause seizures.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: Romero JA, Kuczler FJ (February 1998). \"Isoniazid overdose: recognition and management\".

        "text1": "Title: Coniine\nwikipedia: Coniine is a poisonous chemical compound, an alkaloid present in and isolable from poison hemlock (Conium maculatum), where its presence has been a source of significant economic, medical, and historico-cultural interest; coniine is also produced by the yellow pitcher plant (Sarracenia flava), and fool's parsley (Aethusa cynapium). Its ingestion and extended exposure are toxic to humans and all classes of livestock; its mechanism of poisoning involves disruption of the central nervous system, with death caused by respiratory paralysis. The biosynthesis of coniine contains as its penultimate step the non-enzymatic cyclisation of 5-oxooctylamine to \u03b3-coniceine, a Schiff base differing from coniine only by its carbon-nitrogen double bond in the ring. This pathway results in natural coniine that is a mixture\u2014a racemate\u2014composed of two enantiomers, the stereoisomers (S)-(+)-coniine and (R)-(\u2212)-coniine, depending on the direction taken by the chain that branches from the ring. Both enantiomers are toxic, with the (R)-enantiomer being the more biologically active and toxic of the two in general. Coniine holds a place in organic chemistry history as being the first of the important class of alkaloids to be synthesized, by Albert Ladenburg in 1886, and it has been synthesized in the laboratory in a number of unique ways through to modern times.\nHemlock poisoning has been a periodic human concern, a regular veterinary concern, and has had significant occurrences in human and cultural history. Notably, in 399 BC, Socrates was sentenced to death by drinking a coniine-containing mixture of poison hemlock.\n\nNatural origins: Poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) contains highly toxic amounts of coniine. Its presence on farmland is an issue for livestock farmers because animals will eat it if they are not well fed or the hemlock is mixed in with pasture grass. The coniine is present in Conium maculatum as a mixture of the R-(\u2212)- and S-(+)-enantiomers. \n\nConiine is also found in Sarracenia flava, the yellow pitcher plant. The yellow pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant endemic to the southeastern United States. The plant uses a mixture of sugar and coniine to simultaneously attract and poison insects, which then fall into a digestive tube. Coniine is also found in Aethusa cynapium, commonly known as fool's parsley.\n\nHistory of natural isolates: The history of coniine is understandably tied to the poison hemlock plant, since the natural product was not synthesizable until the 1880s. Jews in the Middle East were poisoned by coniine after consuming quail in the area that usually ate hemlock seeds, and Greeks on the island of Lesbos who also consumed quail suffered from the same poisoning, causing myoglobinuria and acute kidney injury. The most famous hemlock poisoning occurred in 399 BCE, when the philosopher Socrates is believed to have consumed a liquid infused with hemlock to carry out his death sentence, his having been convicted of impiety toward the gods, and the corruption of youth. Hemlock juice was often used to execute criminals in ancient Greece.\nHemlock has had a limited medical use throughout history. The Greeks used it not just as capital punishment, but also as an antispasmodic and treatment for arthritis. Books from the 10th century attest to medical use by the Anglo-Saxons. In the Middle Ages it was believed that hemlock could be used to cure rabies; in later European times it came to be associated with flying ointments in witchcraft. Native Americans used hemlock extract as arrow poison.\nWhile the yellow pitcher plant and fool's parsley also contain coniine, there are no reports of traditional uses for these plants.\n\nPharmacology and toxicology: The (R)-(\u2212) enantiomer of coniine is the more biologically active, at least in one system (TE-671 cells expressing human fetal nicotinic neuromuscular receptors), and in mouse bioassay, the same enantiomer and the racemic mixture are about two-fold more toxic than the (S)-(+) enantiomer (see below).\nConiine, as racemate or as pure enantiomer, begins by binding and stimulating the nicotinic receptor on the post-synaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. The subsequent depolarization results in nicotinic toxicity; as coniine stays bound to the receptor, the nerve stays depolarized, inactivating it. This results, systemically, in a flaccid paralysis, an action similar to that of succinylcholine since they are both depolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Symptoms of paralysis generally occur within a half-hour, although death may take several hours. The central nervous system is not affected: the person remains conscious and aware until respiratory paralysis results in cessation of breathing. The flaccid, muscular paralysis is an ascending paralysis, lower limbs being first affected. The person may have a hypoxic convulsion just prior to death, disguised by the muscular paralysis such that the person may just weakly shudder. Cause of death is lack of oxygen to the brain and heart as a consequence of respiratory paralysis, so that a poisoned person may recover if artificial ventilation can be maintained until the toxin is removed from the victim's system.\nThe LD50 values (in mouse, i.v. administered) for the R-(\u2212) and S-(+) enantiomers, and the racemate, are approximately 7 and 12, and 8 milligrams per kilogram, respectively.\n\nChemical properties: (+/\u2013)-Coniine was first isolated by Giesecke, but the formula was suggested by Blyth and definitely established by Hofmann.\nD-(S)-Coniine has since been determined to be a colorless alkaline liquid, with a penetrating odour and a burning taste; has D0\u00b0 0.8626 and D19\u00b0 0.8438, refractive index n23\u00b0D 1.4505, and is dextrorotatory, [\u03b1]19\u00b0D +15.7\u00b0 (see related comments under Specific rotation section below). L-(R)-Coniine has [\u03b1]21\u00b0D 15\u00b0 and in other respects resembles its D-isomer, but the salts have slightly different melting points; the platinichloride has mp. 160 \u00b0C (L\u00f6ffler and Friedrich report 175 \u00b0C), the aurichloride mp. 59 \u00b0C.\n\nSolubility: Coniine is slightly soluble (1 in 90) in cold water, less so in hot water, so that a clear cold solution becomes turbid when warmed. On the other hand, the base dissolves about 25% of water at room temperature. It mixes with alcohol in all proportions, is readily soluble in ether and most organic solvents. Coniine dissolves in carbon disulfide, forming a complex thiocarbamate.\n\nCrystallization: Coniine solidifies into a soft crystalline mass at \u22122 \u00b0C. It slowly oxidizes in the air. The salts crystallize well and are soluble in water or alcohol. The hydrochloride, B\u2022HCl, crystallizes from water in rhombs, mp. 220 \u00b0C, [\u03b1]20\u00b0D +10.1\u00b0; the hydrobromide, in needles, mp. 211 \u00b0C, and the D-acid tartrate, B\u2022C4H6O6\u20222 H2O, in rhombic crystals, mp. 54 \u00b0C. The platinichloride, (B\u2022HCl)2\u2022PtCl4\u2022H2O, separates from concentrated solution as an oil, which solidifies to a mass of orange-yellow crystals, mp. 175 \u00b0C (dry). The aurichloride, B\u2022HAuCl4, crystallizes on standing, mp. 77 \u00b0C. The picrate forms small yellow needles, mp. 75 \u00b0C, from hot water. The 2,4-dinitrobenzoyl- and 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl-derivates have mps. 139.0\u2013139.5 \u00b0C and 108\u20139 \u00b0C respectively. The precipitate afforded by potassium cadmium iodide solution is crystalline, mp. 118 \u00b0C, while that given by nicotine with this reagent is amorphous.\n\nColor changes: Coniine gives no coloration with sulfuric or nitric acid. Sodium nitroprusside gives a deep red color, which disappears on warming, but reappears on cooling, and is changed to blue or violet by aldehydes.\n\nSpecific rotation: The stereochemical composition of \"coniine\" is a matter of some importance, since its two enantiomers do not have identical biological properties, and many of the older pharmacological studies on this compound were carried out using the naturally-occurring isomeric mixture. S-(+)-Coniine has a specific rotation, [\u03b1]D, of +8.4\u00b0 (c = 4.0, in CHCl3). These authors note that Ladenburg's value, +15\u00b0, is for a \"neat\", i.e. undiluted, sample. A similarly high value of +16\u00b0 for the [\u03b1]D of \"coniine\" is given, without explicit citation of the source, in The Merck Index. The value of +7.7\u00b0 (c = 4.0, CHCl3) for synthetic S-(+)-coniine and -7.9\u00b0 (c = 0.5, CHCl3) for synthetic R-(\u2212)-coniine is given by other chemists. The hydrochloride salts of the (S)-(+) and (R)-(\u2212) enantiomers of coniine have values of [\u03b1]D of +4.6\u00b0 and -5.2\u00b0, respectively (c = 0.5, in methanol).\n\nSynthesis: The original synthesis (shown below) of Coniine was performed by Ladenburg in 1886. Ladenburg heated N-methylpyridine iodide to 250 \u00b0C, to obtain 2-methylpyridine. He then performed a Knoevenagel condensation with acetaldehyde in anhydrous zinc chloride to yield 2-propenylpyridine. In fact, Ladenburg used paraldehyde, a cyclic trimer of acetaldehyde that readily forms acetaldehyde upon heating. Finally, 2-propenylpyridine was reduced with metallic sodium in ethanol to provide racemic (\u00b1) coniine. Fractional crystallisation of racemic coniine with (+)-tartaric acid yielded enantiopure coniine.\n\nThe scheme proposed by Ladenburg gave poor yields, so the quest for alternative routes was open. A slightly better yield is observed if 2-methylpyridine and acetaldehyde are heated in a sealed tube with hydrochloric acid for 10 hours. A mixture of 2-propenylpyridine and 2-chloropropylpyridine is formed and is subsequently reduced by sodium in ethanol to give rac-coniine. Note: although the scheme below shows a single enantiomer of coniine, the final reaction produces a racemic mixture that is then separated\n\nIn 1907, another route with better yield was proposed. First, 2-(2'-hydroxypropyl)pyridine is reduced with phosphorus and fuming hydroiodic acid at 125 \u00b0C. Second, the product is treated with zinc dust and water. Finally, the product of the second step is treated with sodium in ethanol. Note: although the graphic below shows a single enantiomer of coniine, this reaction produces a racemic mixture that is then purified and separated. \n\nA number of other syntheses of coniine have been effected, of which that of Diels and Alder is of special interest. The initial adduct of pyridine and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate is tetramethylquinolizine-1,2,3,4-tetracarboxylate, which on oxidation with dilute nitric acid is converted into trimethyl indolizine-tricarboxylate. This, on hydrolysis and decarboxylation, furnishes indolizine, the octahydro-derivate of which, also known as octahydropyrrocoline is converted by the cyanogen bromide method successively into the bromocyanamide, cyanamide and rac.-coniine. A synthesis of the alkaloid, starting from indolizine (pyrrocoline) is described by Ochiai and Tsuda.\n\nThe preparation of L-(R)-coniine by the reduction of \u03b2-coniceine (L-propenylpiperidine) by L\u00f6ffler and Friedrich provides means for converting conhydrine to L-(R)-coniine. Hess and Eichel reported, incorrectly, that pelletierine was the aldehyde (\u03b2-2-piperidyl-propaldehyde) corresponding to coniine, and yielded rac-coniine when its hydrazone was heated with sodium ethoxide in ethanol at 156\u2013170 \u00b0C. According to these authors, D-(S)-coniine is rendered almost optically inactive when heated with barium hydroxide and alcohol at 180\u2013230 \u00b0C. Leithe has shown by observation of the optical rotation of (+)-pipecolic acid (piperidine-2-carboxylic acid) and some of its derivatives under varying conditions, that it must belong to the D-series of amino acids.\nCurrently, Coniine, and many other alkaloids, can be synthesized stereoselectively. For example, Pd-catalyzed 1,3-chirality transfer reaction can stereospecifically transform a single enantiomer of an allyl alcohol into a cyclic structure (in this case a piperidine). In this way, starting from (S)-alcohol an (S)-enantiomer of Coniine is obtained and vice versa. Remarkably, the separation of racemic alcohol into different enantiomers is done with the help of Candida antarctica lipase.\n\nBiosynthesis: The biosynthesis of coniine is still being investigated, but much of the pathway has been elucidated. Originally thought to use 4 acetyl groups as feed compounds for the polyketide synthase that forms coniine, it is in fact derived from two malonyl and a butyryl CoA, which are derived in the usual way from acetyl-CoA.\n\n \nFurther elongation of butyryl-CoA using 2 malonyl-CoA forms 5-ketooctanal.  Ketooctanal then undergoes transamination using  alanine:5-keto-octanal aminotransferase. The amine then spontaneously cyclizes and is dehydrated to form the coniine precursor \u03b3\u2013coniceine.  This is then reduced using NADPH dependent y-coniceine reductase to form coniine.\n\nIn popular culture: Coniine is the murder weapon in Agatha Christie's mystery novel Five Little Pigs.\nThe R and S 2-Propylpiperidine stereoisomers are a neurotoxin present in a slug-like lifeform in The Expanse. The toxin is shown as causing almost instant death upon skin contact in the show.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: Green, Benedict T.; Lee, Stephen T.; Panter, Kip E.; Brown, David R.

        "text2": "Title: Piperidine\nwikipedia: Piperidine is an organic compound with the molecular formula (CH2)5NH. This heterocyclic amine consists of a six-membered ring containing five methylene bridges (\u2013CH2\u2013) and one amine bridge (\u2013NH\u2013). It is a colorless liquid with an odor described as objectionable, typical of amines. The name comes from the genus name Piper, which is the Latin word for pepper. Although piperidine is a common organic compound, it is best known as a representative structure element within many pharmaceuticals and alkaloids, such as natural-occurring solenopsins.\n\nProduction: Piperidine was first reported in 1850 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Anderson and again, independently, in 1852 by the French chemist Auguste Cahours, who named it. Both of them obtained piperidine by reacting piperine with nitric acid.\nIndustrially, piperidine is produced by the hydrogenation of pyridine, usually over a molybdenum disulfide catalyst:\n\nC5H5N + 3 H2 \u2192 C5H10NH\nPyridine can also be reduced to piperidine via a modified Birch reduction using sodium in ethanol.\n\nNatural occurrence of piperidine and derivatives: Piperidine itself has been obtained from black pepper, from Psilocaulon absimile (Aizoaceae), and in Petrosimonia monandra.\nThe piperidine structural motif is present in numerous natural alkaloids. These include piperine, which gives black pepper its spicy taste. This gave the compound its name. Other examples are the fire ant toxin solenopsin, the nicotine analog anabasine of tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca), lobeline of Indian tobacco, and the toxic alkaloid coniine from poison hemlock, which was used to put Socrates to death.\n\nConformation: Piperidine prefers a chair conformation, similar to cyclohexane. Unlike cyclohexane, piperidine has two distinguishable chair conformations: one with the N\u2013H bond in an axial position, and the other in an equatorial position. After much controversy during the 1950s\u20131970s, the equatorial conformation was found to be more stable by 0.72 kcal/mol in the gas phase. In nonpolar solvents, a range between 0.2 and 0.6 kcal/mol has been estimated, but in polar solvents the axial conformer may be more stable. The two conformers interconvert rapidly through nitrogen inversion; the free energy activation barrier for this process, estimated at 6.1 kcal/mol, is substantially lower than the 10.4 kcal/mol for ring inversion. In the case of N-methylpiperidine, the equatorial conformation is preferred by 3.16 kcal/mol, which is much larger than the preference in methylcyclohexane, 1.74 kcal/mol.\n\nReactions: Piperidine is widely used to convert ketones to enamines. Enamines derived from piperidine are substrates in the Stork enamine alkylation reaction.\nUpon treatment with calcium hypochlorite, piperidine converts to N-chloropiperidine, a chloramine with the formula C5H10NCl. The resulting chloramine undergoes dehydrohalogenation to afford the cyclic imine.\n\nNMR chemical control: 13C NMR: (CDCl3, ppm) 47, 27.2, 25.2\n1H NMR: (CDCl3, ppm) 2.79, 2.19, 1.51\n\nUses: Piperidine is used as a solvent and as a base. The same is true for certain derivatives: N-formylpiperidine is a polar aprotic solvent with better hydrocarbon solubility than other amide solvents, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine is a highly sterically hindered base, useful because of its low nucleophilicity and high solubility in organic solvents.\nA significant industrial application of piperidine is for the production of dipiperidinyl dithiuram tetrasulfide, which is used as an accelerator of the sulfur vulcanization of rubber.\n\nList of piperidine medications: Piperidine and its derivatives are ubiquitous building blocks in pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals.

        "text1": "Title: Trehalose\nwikipedia: Trehalose (from Turkish t\u0131gala \u2013 a sugar derived from insect cocoons + -ose) is a sugar consisting of two molecules of glucose.  It is also known as mycose or tremalose. Some bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrate animals synthesize it as a source of energy, and to survive freezing and lack of water.\nExtracting trehalose was once a difficult and costly process, but around 2000, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) discovered an inexpensive extraction technology from starch. Trehalose has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food, cosmetics and as a drug. A procedure developed in 2017 using trehalose allows sperm storage at room temperatures.\n\nStructure: Trehalose is a disaccharide formed by a 1,1-glycosidic bond between two \u03b1-glucose units. It is found in nature as a disaccharide and also as a monomer in some polymers. Two other stereoisomers exist: \u03b1,\u03b2-trehalose, also called neotrehalose, and \u03b2,\u03b2-trehalose, also called isotrehalose. Neither of these alternate isomers has been isolated from living organisms, but isotrehalose has been was found in starch hydroisolates.\n\nSynthesis: At least three biological pathways support trehalose biosynthesis. An industrial process can derive trehalose from corn starch.\n\nProperties: \n\nChemical: Trehalose is a nonreducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1\u20131 alpha bond, giving it the name \u03b1-D-gluco\u00adpyranosyl-(1\u21921)-\u03b1-D-gluco\u00adpyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore is stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The bonding keeps nonreducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation).  Trehalose is less soluble than sucrose, except at high temperatures (>80 \u00b0C). Trehalose forms a rhomboid crystal as the dihydrate, and has 90% of the calorific content of sucrose in that form. Anhydrous forms of trehalose readily regain moisture to form the dihydrate. Anhydrous forms of trehalose can show interesting physical properties when heat-treated.\nTrehalose aqueous solutions show a concentration-dependent clustering tendency. Owing to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, they self-associate in water to form clusters of various sizes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that concentrations of 1.5\u20132.2 molar allow trehalose molecular clusters to percolate and form large and continuous aggregates.\nTrehalose directly interacts with nucleic acids, facilitates melting of double stranded DNA and stabilizes single-stranded nucleic acids.\n\nBiological: Organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and lower and higher plants have enzymes that can make trehalose.\nIn nature, trehalose can be found in plants, and microorganisms.  In animals, trehalose is prevalent in shrimp, and also in insects, including grasshoppers, locusts, butterflies, and bees, in which trehalose serves as blood-sugar. Trehalase genes are found in tardigrades, the microscopic ecdysozoans found worldwide in diverse extreme environments.\nTrehalose is the major carbohydrate energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible reason for this is that the glycosidic linkage of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one glycosidic linkage releases only one glucose molecule.\nIn plants, trehalose is seen in sunflower seeds, moonwort, Selaginella plants, and sea algae. Within the fungi, it is prevalent in some mushrooms, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes), oyster, king oyster, and golden needle.\nEven within the plant kingdom, Selaginella (sometimes called the resurrection plant), which grows in desert and mountainous areas, may be cracked and dried out, but will turn green again and revive after rain because of the function of trehalose.\nThe two prevalent theories as to how trehalose works within the organism in the state of cryptobiosis are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose.\nIn bacterial cell wall, trehalose has a structural role in adaptive responses to stress such as osmotic differences and extreme temperature. Yeast uses trehalose as a carbon source in response to abiotic stresses. In humans, the only known function of trehalose is as a neuroprotective, which it accomplishes by inducing autophagy and thereby clearing protein aggregates.\nTrehalose has also been reported for anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory (in vitro and in vivo) activities, upon its esterification with fatty acids of varying chain lengths.\n\nNutritional and dietary properties: Trehalose is rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which is present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores.:\u200a135\u200a It causes less of a spike in blood sugar than glucose.  Trehalose has about 45% the sweetness of sucrose at concentrations above 22%, but when the concentration is reduced, its sweetness decreases more quickly than that of sucrose, so that a 2.3% solution tastes 6.5 times less sweet as the equivalent sugar solution.:\u200a444\u200a\nIt is commonly used in prepared frozen foods, like ice cream, because it lowers the freezing point of foods.\nDeficiency of trehalase enzyme is unusual in humans, except in the Greenlandic Inuit, where it is present in only 10\u201315% of the population.:\u200a197\n\nMetabolism: Five biosynthesis pathways have been reported for trehalose. The most common pathway is TPS/TPP pathway which is used by organisms that synthesize trehalose using the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase (TPS). Second, trehalose synthase (TS) in certain types of bacteria could produce trehalose by using maltose and another disaccharide with two glucose units as substrates. Third, the TreY-TreZ pathway in some bacteria converts starch that contain maltooligosaccharide or glycogen directly into trehalose. Fourth, in primitive bacteria, trehalose glycisyltransferring synthase (TreT) produces trehalose from ADP-glucose and glucose. Fifth, trehalose phosphorylase (TreP) either hydrolyses trehalose into glucose-1-phosphate and glucose or may act reversibly in certain species. Vertebrates do not have the ability to synthesize or store trehalose. Trehalase in humans is found only in specific location such as the intestinal mucosa, renal brush-border, liver and blood. Expression of this enzyme in vertebrates is initially found during the gestation period that is the highest after weaning. Then, the level of trehalase remained constant in the intestine throughout life. Meanwhile, diets consisting of plants and fungi contain trehalose. Moderate amount of trehalose in diet is essential and having low amount of trehalose could result in diarrhea, or other intestinal symptoms.\n\nMedical use: Trehalose is an ingredient, along with hyaluronic acid, in an artificial tears product used to treat dry eye. Outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile were initially associated with trehalose, but this finding was disputed in 2019.\nIn 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3).\n\nHistory: In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye,  and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from Trehala manna, a substance made by weevils and named it trehalose.\nTrehalose has long been known as an autophagy inducer that acts independently of mTOR. In 2017, research was published showing that trehalose induces autophagy by activating TFEB, a protein that acts as a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway.\n\nSee also: Biostasis\nCryoprotectant\nCryptobiosis\nFreeze drying\nLentztrehalose\nTrehalosamine\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links:  Media related to Trehalose at Wikimedia Commons\nTrehalose in sperm preservation\n\n\n pubchem:\nAlpha,alpha-trehalose is a trehalose in which both glucose residues have alpha-configuration at the anomeric carbon.

        "text2": "Title: Ibuprofen\nwikipedia: Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation. This includes painful menstrual periods, migraines, and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be used to close a patent ductus arteriosus in a premature baby. It can be taken orally (by mouth) or intravenously. It typically begins working within an hour.\nCommon side effects include heartburn, nausea, indigestion, and abdominal pain. As with other NSAIDs, potential side effects include gastrointestinal bleeding. Long-term use has been associated with kidney failure, and rarely liver failure, and it can exacerbate the condition of patients with heart failure. At low doses, it does not appear to increase the risk of heart attack; however, at higher doses it may. Ibuprofen can also worsen asthma. While its safety in early pregnancy is unclear, it appears to be harmful in later pregnancy, so it is not recommended during that period. Like other NSAIDs, it works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins by decreasing the activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). Ibuprofen is a weaker anti-inflammatory agent than other NSAIDs.\nIbuprofen was discovered in 1961 by Stewart Adams and John Nicholson while working at Boots UK Limited and initially marketed as Brufen. It is available under a number of brand names including Advil, Motrin, and Nurofen. Ibuprofen was first marketed in 1969 in the United Kingdom and in 1974 in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 33rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Ibuprofen is used primarily to treat fever (including postvaccination fever), mild to moderate pain (including pain relief after surgery), painful menstruation, osteoarthritis, dental pain, headaches, and pain from kidney stones. About 60% of people respond to any NSAID; those who do not respond well to a particular one may respond to another. A Cochrane medical review of 51 trials of NSAIDs for the treatment of lower back pain found that \"NSAIDs are effective for short-term symptomatic relief in patients with acute low back pain\".\nIt is used for inflammatory diseases such as juvenile idiopathic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is also used for pericarditis and patent ductus arteriosus.\n\nIbuprofen lysine: In some countries, ibuprofen lysine (the lysine salt of ibuprofen, sometimes called \"ibuprofen lysinate\") is licensed for treatment of the same conditions as ibuprofen; the lysine salt is used because it is more water-soluble.\nIn 2006, ibuprofen lysine was approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for closure of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants weighing between 500 and 1,500 g (1 and 3 lb), who are no more than 32 weeks gestational age when usual medical management (such as fluid restriction, diuretics, and respiratory support) is not effective.\n\nAdverse effects: Adverse effects include nausea, heartburn, indigestion, diarrhea, constipation, gastrointestinal ulceration, headache, dizziness, rash, salt and fluid retention, and high blood pressure.\nInfrequent adverse effects include esophageal ulceration, heart failure, high blood levels of potassium, kidney impairment, confusion, and bronchospasm. Ibuprofen can exacerbate asthma, sometimes fatally.\nAllergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, may occur. Ibuprofen may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to demonstrate the presence of the drug in a person having experienced an anaphylactic reaction, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. A monograph relating ibuprofen plasma concentration, time since ingestion, and risk of developing renal toxicity in people who have overdosed has been published.\nIn October 2020, the U.S. FDA required the drug label to be updated for all NSAID medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid.\n\nCardiovascular risk: Along with several other NSAIDs, chronic ibuprofen use is correlated with the risk of progression to hypertension in women, though less than for paracetamol (acetaminophen), and myocardial infarction (heart attack), particularly among those chronically using higher doses. On 9 July 2015, the U.S. FDA toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with ibuprofen and related NSAIDs; the NSAID aspirin is not included in this warning. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued similar warnings in 2015.\n\nSkin: Along with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been associated with the onset of bullous pemphigoid or pemphigoid-like blistering. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen has been reported to be a photosensitizing agent, but it is considered a weak photosensitizing agent compared to other members of the 2-arylpropionic acid class. Like other NSAIDs, ibuprofen is an extremely rare cause of the autoimmune diseases Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis.\n\nInteractions: \n\nAlcohol: Drinking alcohol when taking ibuprofen may increase the risk of stomach bleeding.\n\nAspirin: According to the FDA, \"ibuprofen can interfere with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose aspirin, potentially rendering aspirin less effective when used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention\". Allowing sufficient time between doses of ibuprofen and immediate-release (IR) aspirin can avoid this problem. The recommended elapsed time between a dose of ibuprofen and a dose of aspirin depends on which is taken first. It would be 30 minutes or more for ibuprofen taken after IR aspirin, and 8 hours or more for ibuprofen taken before IR aspirin. However, this timing cannot be recommended for enteric-coated aspirin. If ibuprofen is taken only occasionally without the recommended timing, though, the reduction of the cardioprotection and stroke prevention of a daily aspirin regimen is minimal.\n\nParacetamol (acetaminophen): Ibuprofen combined with paracetamol is considered generally safe in children for short-term usage.\n\nOverdose: Ibuprofen overdose has become common since it was licensed for over-the-counter (OTC) use. Many overdose experiences are reported in the medical literature, although the frequency of life-threatening complications from ibuprofen overdose is low. Human responses in cases of overdose range from an absence of symptoms to a fatal outcome despite intensive-care treatment. Most symptoms are an excess of the pharmacological action of ibuprofen and include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, headache, ear ringing, and nystagmus. Rarely, more severe symptoms such as gastrointestinal bleeding, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, low blood pressure, slow heart rate, fast heart rate, atrial fibrillation, coma, liver dysfunction, acute kidney failure, cyanosis, respiratory depression, and cardiac arrest have been reported. The severity of symptoms varies with the ingested dose and the time elapsed; however, individual sensitivity also plays an important role. Generally, the symptoms observed with an overdose of ibuprofen are similar to the symptoms caused by overdoses of other NSAIDs.\nThe correlation between the severity of symptoms and measured ibuprofen plasma levels is weak. Toxic effects are unlikely at doses below 100 mg/kg, but can be severe above 400 mg/kg (around 150 tablets of 200 mg units for an average adult male); however, large doses do not indicate the clinical course is likely to be lethal. A precise lethal dose is difficult to determine, as it may vary with age, weight, and concomitant conditions of the person.\nTreatment to address an ibuprofen overdose is based on how the symptoms present. In cases presenting early, decontamination of the stomach is recommended. This is achieved using activated charcoal; charcoal absorbs the drug before it can enter the bloodstream. Gastric lavage is now rarely used, but can be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening, and it can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Purposeful vomiting is not recommended. Most ibuprofen ingestions produce only mild effects, and the management of overdose is straightforward. Standard measures to maintain normal urine output should be instituted and kidney function monitored. Since ibuprofen has acidic properties and is also excreted in the urine, forced alkaline diuresis is theoretically beneficial. However, because ibuprofen is highly protein-bound in the blood, the kidneys' excretion of the unchanged drug is minimal. Forced alkaline diuresis is, therefore, of limited benefit.\n\nMiscarriage: A Canadian study of pregnant women suggests that those taking any type or amount of NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen) were 2.4 times more likely to miscarry than those not taking the medications. However, an Israeli study found no increased risk of miscarriage in the group of mothers using NSAIDs.\n\nPharmacology: NSAIDs such as ibuprofen work by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). PGH2, in turn, is converted by other enzymes to several other prostaglandins (which are mediators of pain, inflammation, and fever) and to thromboxane A2 (which stimulates platelet aggregation, leading to the formation of blood clots).\nLike aspirin and indomethacin, ibuprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor, in that it inhibits two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2. The analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity of NSAIDs appears to operate mainly through inhibition of COX-2, which decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation. Inhibition of COX-1 instead would be responsible for unwanted effects on the gastrointestinal tract. However, the role of the individual COX isoforms in the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and gastric damage effects of NSAIDs is uncertain, and different compounds cause different degrees of analgesia and gastric damage.\nIbuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. The R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer in vivo. The S-enantiomer is believed to be the more pharmacologically active enantiomer. The R-enantiomer is converted through a series of three main enzymes. These enzymes include acyl-CoA-synthetase, which converts the R-enantiomer to (\u2212)-R-ibuprofen I-CoA; 2-arylpropionyl-CoA epimerase, which converts (\u2212)-R-ibuprofen I-CoA to (+)-S-ibuprofen I-CoA; and hydrolase, which converts (+)-S-ibuprofen I-CoA to the S-enantiomer. In addition to the conversion of ibuprofen to the S-enantiomer, the body can metabolize ibuprofen to several other compounds, including numerous hydroxyl, carboxyl and glucuronyl metabolites. Virtually all of these have no pharmacological effects.\nUnlike most other NSAIDs, ibuprofen also acts as an inhibitor of Rho kinase and may be useful in recovery from spinal cord injury. Another unusual activity is inhibition of the sweet taste receptor.\n\nPharmacokinetics: After oral administration, peak serum concentration is reached after 1\u20132 hours, and up to 99% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins. The majority of ibuprofen is metabolized and eliminated within 24 hours in the urine; however, 1% of the unchanged drug is removed through biliary excretion.\n\nChemistry: Ibuprofen is practically insoluble in water, but very soluble in most organic solvents like ethanol (66.18 g/100 mL at 40 \u00b0C for 90% EtOH), methanol, acetone and dichloromethane.\nThe original synthesis of ibuprofen by the Boots Group started with the compound isobutylbenzene. The synthesis took six steps. A modern, greener technique with fewer waste byproducts for the synthesis involves only three steps and was developed in the 1980s by the Celanese Chemical Company. The synthesis is initiated with the acylation of isobutylbenzene using the recyclable Lewis acid catalyst hydrogen fluoride. The following catalytic hydrogenation of isobutylacetophenone is performed with either Raney nickel or palladium on carbon to lead into the key-step, the carbonylation of 1-(4-isobutylphenyl)ethanol. This is achieved by a PdCl2(PPh3)2 catalyst, at around 50 bar of CO pressure, in the presence of HCl (10%). The reaction presumably proceeds through the intermediacy of the styrene derivative (acidic elimination of the alcohol) and (1-chloroethyl)benzene derivative (Markovnikow addition of HCl to the double bond).\n\nStereochemistry: Ibuprofen, like other 2-arylpropionate derivatives such as ketoprofen, flurbiprofen and naproxen, contains a stereocenter in the \u03b1-position of the propionate moiety.\n\nThe product sold in pharmacies is a racemic mixture of the S and R-isomers. The S (dextrorotatory) isomer is the more biologically active; this isomer has been isolated and used medically (see dexibuprofen for details).\nThe isomerase enzyme, alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, converts (R)-ibuprofen into the (S)-enantiomer.\n(S)-ibuprofen, the eutomer, harbors the desired therapeutic activity. The inactive (R)-enantiomer, the distomer, undergoes a unidirectional chiral inversion to offer the active (S)-enantiomer. That is, when the ibuprofen is administered as a racemate the distomer is converted in vivo into the eutomer while the latter is unaffected.\n\nHistory: Ibuprofen was derived from propionic acid by the research arm of Boots Group during the 1960s. The name is derived from the 3 functional groups: isobutyl (ibu) propionic acid (pro) phenyl (fen). Its discovery was the result of research during the 1950s and 1960s to find a safer alternative to aspirin. The molecule was discovered and synthesized by a team led by Stewart Adams, with a patent application filed in 1961. Adams initially tested the drug as treatment for his hangover. In 1985, Boots' worldwide patent for ibuprofen expired and generic products were launched.\nThe medication was launched as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the United Kingdom in 1969, and in the United States in 1974. Later, in 1983 and 1984, it became the first NSAID (other than aspirin) to be available over-the-counter (OTC) in these two countries. Boots was awarded the Queen's Award for Technical Achievement in 1985 for the development of the drug.\nIn November 2013, work on ibuprofen was recognized by the erection of a Royal Society of Chemistry blue plaque at Boots' Beeston Factory site in Nottingham, which reads:\n\nIn recognition of the work during the 1980s by The Boots Company PLC on the development of ibuprofen which resulted in its move from prescription-only status to over-the-counter sale, therefore expanding its use to millions of people worldwide\nand another at BioCity Nottingham, the site of the original laboratory, which reads:\n\nIn recognition of the pioneering research work, here on Pennyfoot Street, by Dr Stewart Adams and Dr John Nicholson in the Research Department of Boots which led to the discovery of ibuprofen used by millions worldwide for the relief of pain.\n\nAvailability and administration: Ibuprofen was made available by prescription in the United Kingdom in 1969 and in the United States in 1974.\nIbuprofen is the International nonproprietary name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), Australian Approved Name (AAN) and United States Adopted Name (USAN). In the United States, it has been sold under the brand-names Motrin and Advil since 1974 and 1984, respectively. Ibuprofen is commonly available in the United States up to the FDA's 1984 dose limit OTC, rarely used higher by prescription.\nIn 2009, the first injectable formulation of ibuprofen was approved in the United States, under the brand name Caldolor.\nIbuprofen can be taken orally (by mouth) (as a tablet, a capsule, or a suspension) and intravenously.\n\nResearch: Ibuprofen is sometimes used for the treatment of acne because of its anti-inflammatory properties, and has been sold in Japan in topical form for adult acne. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen may be useful in the treatment of severe orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure when standing up). NSAIDs are of unclear utility in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\nIbuprofen has been associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease and may delay or prevent it. Aspirin, other NSAIDs, and paracetamol (acetaminophen) had no effect on the risk for Parkinson's. In March 2011, researchers at Harvard Medical School announced in Neurology that ibuprofen had a neuroprotective effect against the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. People regularly consuming ibuprofen were reported to have a 38% lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease, but no such effect was found for other pain relievers, such as aspirin and paracetamol. Use of ibuprofen to lower the risk of Parkinson's disease in the general population would not be problem-free, given the possibility of adverse effects on the urinary and digestive systems.\nSome dietary supplements might be dangerous to take along with ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, but as of 2016, more research needs to be conducted to be certain. These supplements include those that can prevent platelet aggregation, including ginkgo, garlic, ginger, bilberry, dong quai, feverfew, ginseng, turmeric, meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), and willow (Salix spp.); those that contain coumarin, including chamomile, horse chestnut, fenugreek and red clover; and those that increase the risk of bleeding, like tamarind.\nIbuprofen lysine is sold for rapid pain relief; given in the form of its lysine salt, absorption is much quicker (35 minutes for the salt compared to 90\u2013120 minutes for ibuprofen). However, a clinical trial with 351 participants in 2020, funded by Sanofi, found no significant difference between ibuprofen and ibuprofen lysine concerning the eventual onset of action or analgesic efficacy.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \nGB patent 971700, Stewart Sanders Adams & John Stuart Nicholson, \"Anti-Inflammatory Agents\", published 1964-09-30,  assigned to Boots Pure Drug Co Ltd \n\"Evidence for the efficacy of pain medications\" (PDF).

Science.\n\n\n pubchem:\nIbuprofen is a monocarboxylic acid that is propionic acid in which one of the hydrogens at position 2 is substituted by a 4-(2-methylpropyl)phenyl group. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, an antipyretic, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant, a radical scavenger, a drug allergen and a geroprotector. It is functionally related to a propionic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an ibuprofen(1-).\nIbuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics. The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin. Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.  On the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer in vivo by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.\nIbuprofen is a Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug. The mechanism of action of ibuprofen is as a Cyclooxygenase Inhibitor.\nIbuprofen is a commonly used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAID) drug which is available both by prescription and over-the-counter. Ibuprofen is considered to be among the safest NSAIDs and is generally well tolerated but can, nevertheless, rarely cause clinically apparent and serious acute liver injury.\nIbuprofen has been reported in Plantago major, Syzygium aromaticum, and Artemisia argyi with data available.\nIbuprofen Sodium is the sodium salt form of ibuprofen, a propionic acid derivate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities. Upon administration, ibuprofen inhibits the activity of cyclo-oxygenase I and II, resulting in a decreased formation of precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. This leads to decreased prostaglandin synthesis, by prostaglandin synthase, the main physiologic effect of ibuprofen. Ibuprofen also causes a decrease in the formation of thromboxane A2 synthesis, by thromboxane synthase, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation.\nIbuprofen is a propionic acid derivate and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects.

It is used for relief of symptoms of arthritis, primary dysmenorrhoea, and fever; Ibuprofen is an NSAID which is believed to work through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), thus inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. There are at least 2 variations of cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2), ibuprofen inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. It appears that its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory activity are achieved principally through COX-2 inhibition; whereas COX-1 inhibition is responsible for its unwanted effects on platelet aggregation and the GI mucosa. As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen inhibits platelet aggregation, but is not used therapeutically for this action since it is a minor and reversible effect. -- Wikipedia.\nA non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties\nSee also: Ibuprofen Sodium (active moiety of); Ibuprofen Lysine (active moiety of); Ibuprofen; pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (component of) ...

        "text2": "Title: Methionine\nwikipedia: Methionine (symbol Met or M) () is an essential amino acid in humans.\nAs the precursor of other non-essential amino acids such as cysteine and taurine, versatile compounds such as SAM-e, and the important antioxidant glutathione, methionine plays a critical role in the metabolism and health of many species, including humans. Methionine is also involved in angiogenesis and various processes related to DNA transcription, epigenetic expression, and gene regulation.\nMethionine was first isolated in 1921 by John Howard Mueller. It is encoded by the codon AUG. It was named by Satoru Odake in 1925, as an abbreviation of its structural description 2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid.\n\nBiochemical details: Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M; encoded by the codon AUG) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated \u2212COO\u2212 form under biological pH conditions), an amino group (which is in the protonated \u2212NH+3 form under biological pH conditions) located in \u03b1-position with respect to the carboxyl group, and an S-methyl thioether side chain, classifying it as a nonpolar, aliphatic amino acid.\nIn nuclear genes of eukaryotes and in Archaea, methionine is coded for by the start codon, meaning it indicates the start of the coding region and is the first amino acid produced in a nascent polypeptide during mRNA translation.\n\nA proteinogenic amino acid: Cysteine and methionine are the two sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acids. Excluding the few exceptions where methionine may act as a redox sensor (e.g.,methionine sulfoxide), methionine residues do not have a catalytic role. This is in contrast to cysteine residues, where the thiol group has a catalytic role in many proteins. The thioether within methionine does however have a minor structural role due to the stability effect of S/\u03c0 interactions between the side chain sulfur atom and aromatic amino acids in one-third of all known protein structures. This lack of a strong role is reflected in experiments where little effect is seen in proteins where methionine is replaced by norleucine, a straight hydrocarbon sidechain amino acid which lacks the thioether.\nIt has been conjectured that norleucine was present in early versions of the genetic code, but methionine intruded into the final version of the genetic code due to the fact it is used in the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). This situation is not unique and may have occurred with ornithine and arginine.\n\nEncoding: Methionine is one of only two amino acids encoded by a single codon (AUG) in the standard genetic code (tryptophan, encoded by UGG, is the other). In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including metazoa and yeast, the codon AUA also encodes for methionine. In the standard genetic code AUA codes for isoleucine and the respective tRNA (ileX in Escherichia coli) uses the unusual base lysidine (bacteria) or agmatidine (archaea) to discriminate against AUG.\nThe methionine codon AUG is also the most common start codon. A \"Start\" codon is message for a ribosome that signals the initiation of protein translation from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a Kozak consensus sequence. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of proteins in eukaryotes and archaea during translation, although it can be removed by post-translational modification. In bacteria, the derivative N-formylmethionine is used as the initial amino acid.\n\nDerivatives: \n\nS-Adenosylmethionine: The methionine-derivative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a methyl donor. SAM-e is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5\u2032 carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a sulfonium cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a soft Lewis acid (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the S-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as cobalamin (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM-e to initiate a radical reaction; these are called radical SAM-e enzymes.\nAs a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosylhomocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into autoinducer-2, which is excreted as a waste product or quorum signal.\n\nBiosynthesis: As an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins.  In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the aspartate family, along with threonine and lysine (via diaminopimelate, but not via \u03b1-aminoadipate). The main backbone is derived from aspartic acid, while the sulfur may come from cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide.\n\nFirst, aspartic acid is converted via \u03b2-aspartyl semialdehyde into homoserine by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a \u03b3-hydroxyl, hence the homo- series). The intermediate aspartate semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead condensed with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants).\nHomoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl.\nIn plants and possibly in some bacteria, phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis.\nIn most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by metX or metA (not homologues).\nIn enterobacteria and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single residue. The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (e.g. lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis).\nThe hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a \u03b3-elimination followed by a variant of a Michael addition. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family, which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP (pyridoxal phosphate), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates.\nIf it reacts with cysteine, it produces cystathionine, which is cleaved to yield homocysteine. The enzymes involved are cystathionine-\u03b3-synthase (encoded by metB in bacteria) and cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase (metC). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing \u03b2 or \u03b3 reactions to occur.\nIf it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase (formerly known as O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either metY or metZ in bacteria.\nIf it reacts with  methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon.\nIf homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two methionine synthases are known; one is cobalamin (vitamin B12) dependent and one is independent.\nThe pathway using cysteine is called the \"transsulfuration pathway\", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called \"direct-sulfurylation pathway\".\nCysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (\"reverse transsulfurylation route\") or from hydrogen sulfide (\"direct sulfurylation route\"); the activated serine is generally O-acetylserine (via CysK or CysM in E. coli), but in Aeropyrum pernix and some other archaea O-phosphoserine is used. CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade.\n\nTranssulfurylation pathway: Enzymes involved in the E. coli transsulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis:\n\nAspartokinase\nAspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase\nHomoserine dehydrogenase\nHomoserine O-transsuccinylase\nCystathionine-\u03b3-synthase\nCystathionine-\u03b2-lyase\nMethionine synthase (in mammals, this step is performed by homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine\u2014homocysteine S-methyltransferase.)\n\nOther biochemical pathways: Although mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways:\n\nCatabolism: Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) by (1) methionine adenosyltransferase.\nSAM-e serves as a methyl donor in many (2) methyltransferase reactions, and is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).\n(3) Adenosylhomocysteinase\ncysteine.\n\nRegeneration: Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) methionine synthase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor.\nHomocysteine can also be remethylated using glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT).  BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase.\n\nReverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine: Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine.\n\n(5) Cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (an enzyme which requires pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6) combines homocysteine and serine to produce cystathionine.  Instead of degrading cystathionine via cystathionine-\u03b2-lyase, as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to cysteine and \u03b1-ketobutyrate via (6) cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase.\n(7) The enzyme \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase converts \u03b1-ketobutyrate to propionyl-CoA, which is metabolized to succinyl-CoA in a three-step process (see propionyl-CoA for pathway).\n\nEthylene synthesis: This amino acid is also used by plants for synthesis of ethylene. The process is known as the Yang cycle or the methionine cycle.\n\nMetabolic diseases: The degradation of methionine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases:\n\nCombined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA)\nHomocystinuria\nMethylmalonic acidemia\nPropionic acidemia\n\nChemical synthesis: The industrial synthesis combines acrolein, methanethiol, and cyanide, which affords the hydantoin. Racemic methionine can also be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate by alkylation with chloroethylmethylsulfide (ClCH2CH2SCH3) followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Also see Methanol.\n\nHuman nutrition: There is inconclusive clinical evidence on methionine supplementation. Dietary restriction of methionine can lead to bone-related disorders.\nMethionine supplementation may benefit those suffering from copper poisoning.\nOverconsumption of methionine, the methyl group donor in DNA methylation, is related to cancer growth in a number of studies.\n\nRequirements: The Food and Nutrition Board  of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For methionine combined with cysteine, for adults 19 years and older, 19 mg/kg body weight/day.\nThis translates to about 1.33 grams per day for a 70 kilogram individual.\n\nDietary sources: High levels of methionine can be found in eggs, meat, and fish; sesame seeds, Brazil nuts, and some other plant seeds; and cereal grains. Most fruits and vegetables contain very little. Most legumes, though protein dense, are low in methionine. Proteins without adequate methionine are not considered to be complete proteins. For that reason, racemic methionine is sometimes added as an ingredient to pet foods.\n\nHealth: Loss of methionine has been linked to senile greying of hair. Its lack leads to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in hair follicles, a reduction in tyrosinase effectiveness, and a gradual loss of hair color. Methionine raises the intracellular concentration of glutathione, thereby promoting antioxidant-mediated cell defense and redox regulation. It also protects cells against dopamine induced nigral cell loss by binding oxidative metabolites.\nMethionine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, taurine, lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. Improper conversion of methionine can lead to atherosclerosis due to accumulation of homocysteine.\n\nOther uses: DL-Methionine is sometimes given as a supplement to dogs; It helps reduce the chances of kidney stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.\nMethionine is allowed as a supplement to organic poultry feed under the US certified organic program.\nMethionine can be used as a nontoxic pesticide option against giant swallowtail caterpillars, which are a serious pest to orange crops.\n\nSee also: Allantoin\nFormylmethionine\nMethionine oxidation\nParacetamol poisoning\nPhotoreactive methionine\nS-Methylcysteine\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Rudra MN, Chowdhury LM (30 September 1950). \"Methionine Content of Cereals and Legumes\".

A sulphur-containing amino acid, methionine improves the tone and pliability of skin, hair, and strengthens nails. Involved in many detoxifying processes, sulphur provided by methionine protects cells from pollutants, slows cell aging, and is essential for absorption and bio-availability of selenium and zinc. Methionine chelates heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, aiding their excretion. It also acts as a lipotropic agent and prevents excess fat buildup in the liver. (NCI04)\nMETHIONINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) and has 12 investigational indications.\nMethionine is a dietary indispensable amino acid required for normal growth and development of humans, other mammals, and avian species. In addition to being a substrate for protein synthesis, it is an intermediate in transmethylation reactions, serving as the major methyl group donor in vivo, including the methyl groups for DNA and RNA intermediates. Methionine is a methyl acceptor for 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyl transferase (methionine synthase), the only reaction that allows for the recycling of this form of folate, and is also a methyl acceptor for the catabolism of betaine. Methionine is also required for synthesis of cysteine. Methionine is accepted as the metabolic precursor for cysteine. Only the sulfur atom from methionine is transferred to cysteine; the carbon skeleton of cysteine is donated by serine.  The adequacy range of dietary requirements of specific amino acids in disease states is difficult to determine. Requirements may not be similar in disease with regard to protein synthesis. Requirements for this purpose can be assessed only when such a function can be measured and related to clinical outcome. There is apparent consensus concerning normal sulfur amino acid (SAA) requirements. WHO recommendations amount to 13 mg/kg per 24 h in healthy adults. This amount is roughly doubled in artificial nutrition regimens. In disease or after trauma, requirements may be altered for methionine, cysteine, and taurine. Although in specific cases of congenital enzyme deficiency, prematurity, or diminished liver function, hypermethionemia or hyperhomocysteinemia may occur, SAA supplementation can be considered safe in amounts exceeding 2-3 times the minimal recommended daily intake. Apart from some very specific indications (e.g., acetaminophen poisoning) the usefulness of SAA supplementation is not yet established. Methionine is known to exacerbate psychopathological symptoms in schizophrenic patients, there is no evidence of similar effects in healthy subjects. The role of methionine as a precursor of homocysteine is the most notable cause for concern. A loading dose of methionine (0.1 g/kg) has been given, and the resultant acute increase in plasma homocysteine has been used as an index of the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease. Although this procedure results in vascular dysfunction, this is acute and unlikely to result in permanent damage. However, a 10-fold larger dose, given mistakenly, resulted in death. Longer-term studies in adults have indicated no adverse consequences of moderate fluctuations in dietary methionine intake, but intakes higher than 5 times normal resulted in elevated homocysteine levels. These effects of methionine on homocysteine and vascular function are moderated by supplements of vitamins B-6, B-12, C, and folic acid. In infants, methionine intakes of 2 to 5 times normal resulted in impaired growth and extremely high plasma methionine levels, but no adverse long-term consequences were observed.

        "text2": "Title: Salicylic Acid\nwikipedia: Salicylic acid is an organic compound with the formula HOC6H4COOH. A colorless (or white), bitter-tasting solid, it is a precursor to and a metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). It is a plant hormone, and has been listed by the EPA Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory as an experimental teratogen. The name is from Latin salix for willow tree, from which it was initially identified and derived. It is an  ingredient in some anti-acne products. Salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates.\n\nUses: \n\nMedicine: Salicylic acid as a medication is commonly used to remove the outermost layer of the skin. As such, it is used to treat warts, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, ringworm, dandruff, and ichthyosis.\nSimilar to other hydroxy acids, salicylic acid is an ingredient in many skincare products for the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, acanthosis nigricans, ichthyosis, and warts.\n\nUses in manufacturing: Salicylic acid is used as a food preservative, a bactericide, and an antiseptic.\nSalicylic acid is used in the production of other pharmaceuticals, including 4-aminosalicylic acid, sandulpiride, and landetimide (via salethamide). It is also used in picric acid production.\nSalicylic acid has long been a key starting material for making acetylsalicylic acid (ASA or aspirin). ASA is prepared by the acetylation of salicylic acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. ASA is the standard to which all the other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are compared. In veterinary medicine, this group of drugs is mainly used for treatment of inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders.\nBismuth subsalicylate, a salt of bismuth and salicylic acid, \"displays anti-inflammatory action (due to salicylic acid) and also acts as an antacid and mild antibiotic\". It is an active ingredient in stomach-relief aids such as Pepto-Bismol and some formulations of Kaopectate.\nOther derivatives include methyl salicylate, used as a liniment to soothe joint and muscle pain, and choline salicylate, which is used topically to relieve the pain of mouth ulcers. Aminosalicylic acid is used to induce remission in ulcerative colitis, and has been used as an antitubercular agent often administered in association with isoniazid.\nSodium salicylate is a useful phosphor in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral range, with nearly flat quantum efficiency for wavelengths between 10 and 100 nm. It fluoresces in the blue at 420 nm. It is easily prepared on a clean surface by spraying a saturated solution of the salt in methanol followed by evaporation.\n\nMechanism of action: Salicylic acid modulates COX-1 enzymatic activity to decrease the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation.\nSalicylic acid, when applied to the skin surface, works by causing the cells of the epidermis to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth. Salicylic acid inhibits the oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) competitively with NADH and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid  to the phenolic acceptor.\nThe wound-healing retardation action of salicylates is probably due mainly to its inhibitory action on mucopolysaccharide synthesis.\n\nSafety: If high concentrations of salicylic ointment are used topically, high levels of salicylic acid can enter the blood, requiring hemodialysis to avoid further complications.\nCosmetic applications of the drug pose no significant risk. Even in a worst-case use scenario in which one was using multiple salicylic acid-containing topical products, the aggregate plasma concentration of salicylic acid was well below what was permissible for acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Since oral aspirin (which produces much higher salicylic acid plasma concentrations than dermal salicylic acid applications) poses no significant adverse pregnancy outcomes in terms of frequency of stillbirth, birth defects or developmental delay, use of salicylic acid containing cosmetics is safe for pregnant women. Salicylic acid is present in most fruits and vegetables as for example in greatest quantities in berries and in beverages like tea.\n\nProduction and chemical reactions: \n\nBiosynthesis: Salicylic acid is biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine. In Arabidopsis thaliana, it can be synthesized via a phenylalanine-independent pathway.\n\nChemical synthesis: Commercial vendors prepare sodium salicylate by treating sodium phenolate (the sodium salt of phenol) with carbon dioxide at high pressure (100 atm) and high temperature (115 \u00b0C) \u2013 a method known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. Acidifying the product with sulfuric acid gives salicylic acid:\n\nAt the laboratory scale, it can also be prepared by the hydrolysis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) with a strong acid or base; these reactions reverse those chemicals' commercial syntheses.\n\nReactions: Upon heating, salicylic acid converts to phenyl salicylate:\n\nFurther heating gives xanthone.\nSalicylic acid as its conjugate base is a chelating agent, with an affinity for iron(III).\nSalicylic acid slowly degrades to phenol and carbon dioxide at 200\u2013230 \u00b0C: \n\nAll isomers of chlorosalicylic acid and of dichlorosalicylic acid are known.  5-Chlorosalicylic acid is produced by direct chlorination of salicylic acid.\n\nHistory: Willow has long been used for medicinal purposes. Dioscorides, whose writings were highly influential for more than 1,500 years, used \"Itea\" (which was possibly a species of willow)  as a treatment for \"painful intestinal obstructions\", birth control, for \"those who spit blood\", to remove calluses and corns and, externally, as a \"warm pack for gout\". William Turner, in 1597, repeated this, saying that willow bark, \"being burnt to ashes, and steeped in vinegar, takes away corns and other like risings in the feet and toes\". Some of these cures may describe the action of salicylic acid, which can be derived from the salicin present in willow. It is, however, a modern myth that Hippocrates used willow as a painkiller.\nHippocrates, Galen, Pliny the Elder, and others knew that decoctions containing salicylate could ease pain and reduce fevers.\nIt was used in Europe and China to treat these conditions. This remedy is mentioned in texts from Ancient Egypt, Sumer, and Assyria.\nThe Cherokee and other Native Americans use an infusion of the bark for fever and other medicinal purposes. In 2014, archaeologists identified traces of salicylic acid on seventh-century pottery fragments found in east-central Colorado.\nEdward Stone, a vicar from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, reported in 1763 that the bark of the willow was effective in reducing a fever.\n\nAn extract of willow bark, called salicin, after the Latin name for the white willow (Salix alba), was isolated and named by German chemist Johann Andreas Buchner in 1828. A larger amount of the substance was isolated in 1829 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist. Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, was able to convert the substance into a sugar and a second component, which on oxidation becomes salicylic acid.\nSalicylic acid was also isolated from the herb meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. Their extract caused digestive problems such as gastric irritation, bleeding, diarrhea, and even death when consumed in high doses.\nIn 1874 the Scottish physician Thomas MacLagan experimented with salicin as a treatment for acute rheumatism, with considerable success, as he reported in The Lancet in 1876. Meanwhile, German scientists tried sodium salicylate with less success and more severe side effects.\nIn 1979, salicylates were found to be involved in induced defenses of tobacco against tobacco mosaic virus. In 1987, salicylic acid was identified as the long-sought signal that causes thermogenic plants, such as the voodoo lily, Sauromatum guttatum, to produce heat.\n\nDietary sources: Salicylic acid occurs in plants as free salicylic acid and its carboxylated esters and phenolic glycosides. Several studies suggest that humans metabolize salicylic acid in measurable quantities from these plants. High-salicylate beverages and foods include beer, coffee, tea, numerous fruits and vegetables, sweet potato, nuts, and olive oil. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, sugar, breads and cereals have low salicylate content.\nSome people with sensitivity to dietary salicylates may have symptoms of allergic reaction, such as bronchial asthma, rhinitis, gastrointestinal disorders, or diarrhea, so may need to adopt a low-salicylate diet.\n\nPlant hormone: Salicylic acid  is a phenolic phytohormone, and is found in plants with roles in plant growth and development, photosynthesis, transpiration, and ion uptake and transport. Salicylic acid is involved in endogenous signaling, mediating plant defense against pathogens. It plays a role in the resistance to pathogens (i.e. systemic acquired resistance) by inducing the production of pathogenesis-related proteins and other defensive metabolites. SA's defense signaling role is most clearly demonstrated by experiments which do away with it: Delaney et al. 1994, Gaffney et al. 1993, Lawton et al. 1995, and Vernooij et al. 1994 each use Nicotiana tabacum or Arabidopsis expressing nahG, for salicylate hydroxylase. Pathogen inoculation did not produce the customarily high SA levels, SAR was not produced, and no pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were expressed in systemic leaves. Indeed, the subjects were more susceptible to virulent \u2013 and even normally avirulent \u2013 pathogens.\nExogenously, salicylic acid can aid plant development via enhanced seed germination, bud flowering, and fruit ripening, though too high of a concentration of salicylic acid can negatively regulate these developmental processes.\nThe volatile methyl ester of salicylic acid, methyl salicylate, can also diffuse through the air, facilitating plant-plant communication. Methyl salicylate is taken up by the stomata of the nearby plant, where it can induce an immune response after being converted back to salicylic acid.\n\nSignal transduction: A number of proteins have been identified that interact with SA in plants, especially salicylic acid binding proteins (SABPs) and the NPR genes (nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes), which are putative receptors.\n\nSee also: Salsalate\nTrolamine salicylate\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: Schr\u00f6r K (2016).

        "text1": "Title: Carbetapentane\nwikipedia: Pentoxyverine (rINN) or carbetapentane is an antitussive (cough suppressant) commonly used for cough associated with illnesses like common cold. It is sold over-the-counter as Solotuss, or in combination with other medications, especially decongestants. One such product is Certuss, a combination of guaifenesin and pentoxyverine. The drug has been available in the form of drops, suspensions and suppositories. \nIt was formerly available over-the-counter in United States. However, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ruled in 1987 that pentoxyverine was not generally recognized as safe and effective and ordered it to be removed from the over-the-counter market.\n\nUses: The drug is used for the treatment of dry cough associated with conditions such as common cold, bronchitis or sinusitis. Like codeine and other antitussives, it relieves the symptom, but does not heal the illness. No controlled clinical trials regarding the efficiency of pentoxyverine are available.\nPharmacologists use the substance as a selective agonist at the sigma-1 receptor in animal and in vitro experiments.\n\nContraindications: Pentoxyverine is contraindicated in persons with bronchial asthma or other kinds of respiratory insufficiency (breathing difficulties), as well as angle-closure glaucoma. No data are available for the use of pentoxyverine during pregnancy, lactation, or children under two years of age, wherefore the drug must not be used under these circumstances.\nAntitussive drugs are not useful in patients with extensive phlegm production because they prevent coughing up the phlegm.\n\nAdverse effects: The most common side effects (seen in more than 1% of patients) are upper abdominal (belly) pain, diarrhoea, dry mouth, and nausea or vomiting. Allergic reactions of the skin like itching, rashes, hives and angiooedema are rare. The same is true for anaphylactic shock and convulsions.\n\nOverdose: Overdosage leads to drowsiness, agitation, nausea and anticholinergic effects like tachycardia (high heart rate), dry mouth, blurred vision, glaucoma, or urinary retention. Especially in children, pentoxyverine can cause hypoventilation, but much more seldom than codeine and other opioid antitussives.\nThe treatment of overdosage aims at the symptoms; there are no specific antidotes available.\n\nInteractions: No interactions have been described at usual doses. It is possible that pentoxyverine can increase the potency of sedative drugs like benzodiazepines, some anticonvulsants and antidepressants, and alcohol. Likewise, some consumer informations warn patients from taking the drug in combination with or up to two weeks after monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are known to cause potentially fatal reactions in combination with the (chemically only distantly related) antitussive dextromethorphan.\n\nMechanism of action: Pentoxyverine is believed to suppress the cough reflex in the central nervous system, but the exact mechanism of action is not known with certainty. The drug acts as an  antagonist at muscarinic receptors (subtype  M1) and as an agonist at sigma receptors (subtype \u03c31) with an IC50 of 9 nM. Its anticholinergic properties can theoretically relax the pulmonary alveoli and reduce phlegm production. Spasmolytic and local anaesthetic properties have also been described. The clinical relevance of these mechanisms is uncertain.\n\nPharmacokinetics: The substance is absorbed quickly from the gut and reaches its maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) after about two hours. If applied rectally, Cmax is reached after four hours. The bioavailability of the suppositories, measured as area under the curve (AUC), is about twofold that of oral formulations, due to a first pass effect of over 50%. By far the most important metabolisation reaction is ester hydrolysis, which accounts for 26.3% of the total clearance through the kidneys. Only 0.37% are cleared in form of the original substance. The plasma half life is 2.3 hours for oral formulations and three to 3.5 hours for suppositories. Pentoxyverine is also excreted into the breast milk.\n\nChemical properties: Pentoxyverine dihydrogen citrate, the salt that is commonly used for oral preparations, is a white to off-white, crystalline powder. It dissolves easily in water or chloroform, but not in benzene, diethyl ether, or petroleum ether. It melts at 90 to 95 \u00b0C (194 to 203 \u00b0F). Other orally available salts are the hydrochloride and the tannate; suppositories contain the free base.\n\nSee also: Cough syrup\nNoscapine\nCodeine; Pholcodine\nDextromethorphan; Dimemorfan\nRacemorphan; Dextrorphan; Levorphanol\nButamirate\nTipepidine\nCloperastine; Levocloperastine\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\n1-phenyl-1-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid 2-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]ethyl ester is a member of benzenes.\nPentoxyverine, also referred to as carbetapentane, is a non-opioid central acting antitussive with antimuscarinic, anticonvulsant, and local anesthetic properties. It is an active ingredient in over-the-counter cough suppressants in combination with guaifenesin and H1-receptor antagonists. Pentoxyverine acts on sigma-1 receptors, as well as kappa and mu-opioid receptors.  The FDA withdrew the use of all oral gel drug products containing pentoxyverine citrate. Other forms of pentoxyverine citrate continue to be marketed.\nCARBETAPENTANE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) and is indicated for sinusitis and cough.\nsafety: \nsmiles: CCN(CC)CCOCCOC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C2=CC=CC=C2\nforumla: C20H31NO3\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 333.5 g/mol\nXLogP3: 3.8\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 0\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 4\nRotatable Bond Count: 11\nExact Mass: 333.23039385 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 333.23039385 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 38.8\nHeavy Atom Count: 24\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 356\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text2": "Title: Aniline\nwikipedia: Aniline (from Portuguese  anil 'indigo shrub', and -ine indicating a derived substance) is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of a phenyl group (\u2212C6H5) attached to an amino group (\u2212NH2), aniline is the simplest aromatic amine. It is an industrially significant commodity chemical, as well as a versatile starting material for fine chemical synthesis. Its main use is in the manufacture of precursors to polyurethane, dyes, and other industrial chemicals. Like most volatile amines, it has the odor of rotten fish. It ignites readily, burning with a smoky flame characteristic of aromatic compounds. It is toxic to humans.\nRelative to benzene, aniline is \"electron-rich\". It thus participates more rapidly in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions. Likewise, it is also prone to oxidation: while freshly purified aniline is an almost colorless oil, exposure to air results in gradual darkening to yellow or red, due to the formation of strongly colored, oxidized impurities. Aniline can be diazotized to give a diazonium salt, which can then undergo various nucleophilic substitution reactions.\nLike other amines, aniline is both a base (pKaH = 4.6) and a nucleophile, although less so than structurally similar aliphatic amines.\nBecause an early source of the benzene from which they are derived was coal tar, aniline dyes are also called coal tar dyes.\n\nStructure: \n\nAryl-N distances: In aniline, the C\u2212N bond length is 1.41 \u00c5, compared to the C\u2212N bond length of 1.47 \u00c5 for cyclohexylamine, indicating partial \u03c0-bonding between C(aryl) and N. The length of the chemical bond of C(aryl)\u2212NH2 in anilines is highly sensitive to substituent effects. The C\u2212N bond length is 1.34 \u00c5 in 2,4,6-trinitroaniline vs 1.44 \u00c5 in 3-methylaniline.\n\nPyramidalization: The amine group in anilines is a slightly pyramidalized molecule, with hybridization of the nitrogen somewhere between sp3 and sp2. The nitrogen is described as having high p character. The amino group in aniline is flatter (i.e., it is a \"shallower pyramid\") than that in an aliphatic amine, owing to conjugation of the lone pair with the aryl substituent. The observed geometry reflects a compromise between two competing factors: 1) stabilization of the N lone pair in an orbital with significant s character favors pyramidalization (orbitals with s character are lower in energy), while 2) delocalization of the N lone pair into the aryl ring favors planarity (a lone pair in a pure p orbital gives the best overlap with the orbitals of the benzene ring \u03c0 system).\nConsistent with these factors, substituted anilines with electron donating groups are more pyramidalized, while those with electron withdrawing groups are more planar. In the parent aniline, the lone pair is approximately 12% s character, corresponding to sp7.3 hybridization. (For comparison, alkylamines generally have lone pairs in orbitals that are close to sp3.)\nThe pyramidalization angle between the C\u2013N bond and the bisector of the H\u2013N\u2013H angle is 142.5\u00b0. For comparison, in more strongly pyramidal amine group in methylamine, this value is ~125\u00b0, while that of the amine group in formamide has an angle of 180\u00b0.\n\nProduction: Industrial aniline production involves hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (typically at 200\u2013300 \u00b0C) in the presence of metal catalysts: Approximately 4 billion kilograms are produced annually.  Catalysts include nickel, copper, palladium, and platinum, and newer catalysts continue to be discovered.\n\nThe reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline was first performed by Nikolay Zinin in 1842, using sulfide salts (Zinin reaction). The reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline was also performed as part of reductions by Antoine B\u00e9champ in 1854, using iron as the reductant (Bechamp reduction).  These stoichiometric routes remain useful for specialty anilines.\nAniline can alternatively be prepared from ammonia and phenol derived from the cumene process.\nIn commerce, three brands of aniline are distinguished: aniline oil for blue, which is pure aniline; aniline oil for red, a mixture of equimolecular quantities of aniline and ortho- and para-toluidines; and aniline oil for safranine, which contains aniline and ortho-toluidine and is obtained from the distillate (\u00e9chapp\u00e9s) of the fuchsine fusion.\n\nRelated aniline derivatives: Many analogues and derivatives of aniline are known where the phenyl group is further substituted. These include toluidines, xylidines, chloroanilines, aminobenzoic acids, nitroanilines, and many others. They also are usually prepared by nitration of the substituted aromatic compounds followed by reduction. For example, this approach is used to convert toluene into toluidines and chlorobenzene into 4-chloroaniline. Alternatively, using Buchwald-Hartwig coupling or Ullmann reaction approaches, aryl halides can be aminated with aqueous or gaseous ammonia.\n\nReactions: The chemistry of aniline is rich because the compound has been cheaply available for many years. Below are some classes of its reactions.\n\nOxidation: The oxidation of aniline has been heavily investigated, and can result in reactions localized at nitrogen or more commonly results in the formation of new C-N bonds. In alkaline solution, azobenzene results, whereas arsenic acid produces the violet-coloring matter violaniline. Chromic acid converts it into quinone, whereas chlorates, in the presence of certain metallic salts (especially of vanadium), give aniline black. Hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate give chloranil. Potassium permanganate in neutral solution oxidizes it to nitrobenzene; in alkaline solution to azobenzene, ammonia, and oxalic acid; in acid solution to aniline black. Hypochlorous acid gives 4-aminophenol and para-amino diphenylamine. Oxidation with persulfate affords a variety of polyanilines. These polymers exhibit rich redox and acid-base properties.\n\nElectrophilic reactions at ortho- and para- positions: Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly susceptible to electrophilic substitution reactions. Its high reactivity reflects that it is an enamine, which enhances the electron-donating ability of the ring. For example, reaction of aniline with sulfuric acid at 180 \u00b0C produces sulfanilic acid, H2NC6H4SO3H.\nIf bromine water is added to aniline, the bromine water is decolourised and a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline is formed. To generate the mono-substituted product, a protection with acetyl chloride is required:\n\nThe reaction to form 4-bromoaniline is to protect the amine with acetyl chloride, then hydrolyse back to reform aniline.\nThe largest scale industrial reaction of aniline involves its alkylation with formaldehyde. An idealized equation is shown:\n\n2 C6H5NH2 + CH2O \u2192 CH2(C6H4NH2)2 + H2O\nThe resulting diamine is the precursor to 4,4'-MDI and related diisocyanates.\n\nReactions at nitrogen: \n\nBasicity: Aniline is a weak base. Aromatic amines such as aniline are, in general, much weaker bases than aliphatic amines. Aniline reacts with strong acids to form the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5\u2212NH+3).\nTraditionally, the weak basicity of aniline is attributed to a combination of inductive effect from the more electronegative sp2 carbon and resonance effects, as the lone pair on the nitrogen is partially delocalized into the pi system of the benzene ring. (see the picture below):\n\nMissing in such an analysis is consideration of solvation. Aniline is, for example, more basic than ammonia in the gas phase, but ten thousand times less so in aqueous solution.\n\nAcylation: Aniline reacts with acyl chlorides such as acetyl chloride to give amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3\u2212C(=O)\u2212NH\u2212C6H5 is acetanilide. At high temperatures aniline and carboxylic acids react to give the anilides.\n\nN-Alkylation: N-Methylation of aniline with methanol at elevated temperatures over acid catalysts gives N-methylaniline and N,N-dimethylaniline:\n\nC6H5NH2 + 2 CH3OH \u2192 C6H5N(CH3)2 + 2H2O\nN-Methylaniline and N,N-dimethylaniline are colorless liquids with boiling points of 193\u2013195 \u00b0C and 192 \u00b0C, respectively. These derivatives are of importance in the color industry.\n\nCarbon disulfide derivatives: Boiled with carbon disulfide, it gives sulfocarbanilide (diphenylthiourea) (S=C(\u2212NH\u2212C6H5)2), which may be decomposed into phenyl isothiocyanate (C6H5\u2212N=C=S), and triphenyl guanidine (C6H5\u2212N=C(\u2212NH\u2212C6H5)2).\n\nDiazotization: Aniline and its ring-substituted derivatives react with nitrous acid to form diazonium salts.  One example is benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. Through these intermediates, the amine group can be converted to a hydroxyl (\u2212OH), cyanide (\u2212CN), or halide group (\u2212X, where X is a halogen) via Sandmeyer reactions. This diazonium salt can also be reacted with NaNO2 and phenol to produce a dye known as benzeneazophenol, in a process called coupling.\nThe reaction of converting primary aromatic amine into diazonium salt is called diazotisation.\nIn this reaction primary aromatic amine is allowed to react with sodium nitrite and 2 moles of HCl, which is known as \"ice cold mixture\" because the temperature for the reaction was as low as 0.5 \u00b0C. The benzene diazonium salt is formed as major product alongside the byproducts water and sodium chloride.\n\nOther reactions: It reacts with nitrobenzene to produce phenazine in the Wohl\u2013Aue reaction. Hydrogenation gives cyclohexylamine.\nBeing a standard reagent in laboratories, aniline is used for many niche reactions. Its acetate is used in the aniline acetate test for carbohydrates, identifying pentoses by conversion to furfural. It is used to stain neural RNA blue in the Nissl stain.\nIn addition, aniline is the starting component in the production of diglycidyl aniline. Epichlorohydrin is the other main ingredient.\n\nUses: Aniline is predominantly used for the preparation of methylenedianiline and related compounds by condensation with formaldehyde. The diamines are condensed with phosgene to give methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, a precursor to urethane polymers.\n\nOther uses include rubber processing chemicals (9%), herbicides (2%), and dyes and pigments (2%). As additives to rubber, aniline derivatives such as phenylenediamines and diphenylamine, are antioxidants. Illustrative of the drugs prepared from aniline is paracetamol (acetaminophen, Tylenol). The principal use of aniline in the dye industry is as a precursor to indigo, the blue of blue jeans.\n\nAniline oil is also used for mushroom identification.\nKerrigan's 2016 Agaricus of North America P45: (Referring to Schaffer's reaction) \"In fact I recommend switching to the following modified test. Frank (1988) developed an alternative formulation in which aniline oil is combined with glacial acetic acid (GAA, essentially distilled vinegar) in a 50:50 solution. GAA is a much safer, less reactive acid. This single combined reagent is relatively stable over time. A single spot or line applied to the pileus (or other surface). In my experience the newer formulation works as well as Schaffer's while being safer and more convenient.\"\n\nHistory: Aniline was first isolated in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben by destructive distillation of indigo. He called it Crystallin. In 1834, Friedlieb Runge isolated a substance from coal tar that turned a beautiful blue color when treated with chloride of lime. He named it kyanol or cyanol. In 1840, Carl Julius Fritzsche (1808\u20131871) treated indigo with caustic potash and obtained an oil that he named aniline, after an indigo-yielding plant, anil (Indigofera suffruticosa). In 1842, Nikolay Nikolaevich Zinin reduced nitrobenzene and obtained a base that he named benzidam. In 1843, August Wilhelm von Hofmann showed that these were all the same substance, known thereafter as phenylamine or aniline.\n\nSynthetic dye industry: In 1856, while trying to synthesise quinine, von Hofmann's student William Henry Perkin discovered mauveine.  Mauveine quickly became a commercial dye.  Other synthetic dyes followed, such as fuchsin, safranin, and induline. At the time of mauveine's discovery, aniline was expensive. Soon thereafter, applying a method reported in 1854 by Antoine B\u00e9champ, it was prepared \"by the ton\". The B\u00e9champ reduction enabled the evolution of a massive dye industry in Germany. Today, the name of BASF, originally Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (English: Baden Aniline and Soda Factory), now the largest chemical supplier, echoes the legacy of the synthetic dye industry, built via aniline dyes and extended via the related azo dyes. The first azo dye was aniline yellow.\n\nDevelopments in medicine: In the late 19th century, derivatives of aniline such as acetanilide and phenacetin emerged as analgesic drugs, with their cardiac-suppressive side effects often countered with caffeine. During the first decade of the 20th century, while trying to modify synthetic dyes to treat African sleeping sickness, Paul Ehrlich \u2013 who had coined the term chemotherapy for his magic bullet approach to medicine \u2013 failed and switched to modifying B\u00e9champ's atoxyl, the first organic arsenical drug, and serendipitously obtained a treatment for syphilis \u2013 salvarsan \u2013 the first successful chemotherapy agent. Salvarsan's targeted microorganism, not yet recognized as a bacterium, was still thought to be a parasite, and medical bacteriologists, believing that bacteria were not susceptible to the chemotherapeutic approach, overlooked Alexander Fleming's report in 1928 on the effects of penicillin.\nIn 1932, Bayer sought medical applications of its dyes. Gerhard Domagk identified as an antibacterial a red azo dye, introduced in 1935 as the first antibacterial drug, prontosil, soon found at Pasteur Institute to be a prodrug degraded in vivo into sulfanilamide \u2013 a colorless intermediate for many, highly colorfast azo dyes \u2013 already with an expired patent, synthesized in 1908 in Vienna by the researcher Paul Gelmo for his doctoral research. By the 1940s, over 500 related sulfa drugs were produced. Medications in high demand during World War II (1939\u201345), these first miracle drugs, chemotherapy of wide effectiveness, propelled the American pharmaceutics industry. In 1939, at Oxford University, seeking an alternative to sulfa drugs, Howard Florey developed Fleming's penicillin into the first systemic antibiotic drug, penicillin G. (Gramicidin, developed by Ren\u00e9 Dubos at Rockefeller Institute in 1939, was the first antibiotic, yet its toxicity restricted it to topical use.) After World War II, Cornelius P. Rhoads introduced the chemotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment.\n\nRocket fuel: Some early American rockets, such as the Aerobee and WAC Corporal, used a mixture of aniline and furfuryl alcohol as a fuel, with nitric acid as an oxidizer. The combination is hypergolic, igniting on contact between fuel and oxidizer. It is also dense, and can be stored for extended periods. Aniline was later replaced by hydrazine.\n\nToxicology and testing: Aniline is toxic by inhalation of the vapour, ingestion, or percutaneous absorption. The IARC lists it in Group 2A (Probably carcinogenic to humans), and it has specifically been linked to bladder cancer.\nAniline has been implicated as one possible cause of forest dieback.\nMany methods exist for the detection of aniline.\n\nOxidative DNA damage: Exposure of rats to aniline can elicit a response that is toxic to the spleen, including a tumorigenic response. Rats exposed to aniline in drinking water, showed a significant increase in oxidative DNA damage to the spleen, detected as a 2.8-fold increase in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in their DNA. Although the base excision repair pathway was also activated, its activity was not sufficient to prevent the accumulation of 8-OHdG. The accumulation of oxidative DNA damages in the spleen following exposure to aniline may increase mutagenic events that underlie tumorigenesis.\n\nNotes: \n\nReferences: This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.

It does not readily evaporate at room temperature. Aniline is slightly soluble in water and mixes readily with most organic solvents. Aniline is used to make a wide variety of products such as polyurethane foam, agricultural chemicals, synthetic dyes, antioxidants, stabilizers for the rubber industry, herbicides, varnishes and explosives\nAniline can cause cancer according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nAniline appears as a yellowish to brownish oily liquid with a musty fishy odor. Melting point -6 \u00b0C; boiling point 184 \u00b0C; flash point 158 \u00b0F. Denser than water (8.5 lb / gal) and slightly soluble in water. Vapors heavier than air. Toxic by skin absorption and inhalation. Produces toxic oxides of nitrogen during combustion. Used to manufacture other chemicals, especially dyes, photographic chemicals, agricultural chemicals and others.\nAniline is a primary arylamine in which an amino functional group is substituted for one of the benzene hydrogens. It is a primary arylamine and a member of anilines.\nAniline, phenylamine or aminobenzene is an organic compound with the formula C6H5NH2. Consisting of an amine attached to a benzene ring, aniline is the prototypical aromatic amine. Being a precursor to many industrial chemicals, its main use is in the manufacture of precursors to polyurethane. Like most volatile amines, it possesses the somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish. Aniline is colorless, but it slowly oxidizes and resinifies in air, giving a red-brown tint to aged samples.\nExposure to aniline may occur from breathing contaminated outdoor air, smoking tobacco, or working or being near industries where it is produced or used. The acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) effects of aniline in humans consist mainly of effects on the lung, such as upper respiratory tract irritation and congestion. Chronic exposure may also result in effects on the blood. Human cancer data are insufficient to conclude that aniline is a cause of bladder tumors while animal studies indicate that aniline causes tumors of the spleen. EPA has classified aniline as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen.\nAniline has been reported in Camellia sinensis and Trigonella foenum-graecum with data available.\nAniline is an organic chemical compound, specifically a primary aromatic amine. It consists of a benzene ring attached to an amino group. Aniline is oily and, although colorless, it can be slowly oxidized and resinified in air to form impurities which can give it a red-brown tint. Its boiling point is 184 degree centigrade and its melting point is -6 degree centegrade. It is a liquid at room temperature. Like most volatile amines, it possesses a somewhat unpleasant odour of rotten fish, and also has a burning aromatic taste; it is a highly acrid poison. It ignites readily, burning with a large smoky flame. Aniline reacts with strong acids to form salts containing the anilinium (or phenylammonium) ion (C6H5-NH3+), and reacts with acyl halides (such as acetyl chloride (ethanoyl chloride), CH3COCl) to form amides. The amides formed from aniline are sometimes called anilides, for example CH3-CO-NH-C6H5 is acetanilide, for which the modern name is N-phenyl ethanamide. Like phenols, aniline derivatives are highly reactive in electrophilic substitution reactions. For example, sulfonation of aniline produces sulfanilic acid, which can be converted to sulfanilamide. Sulfanilamide is one of the sulfa drugs which were widely used as antibacterial in the early 20th century. Aniline was first isolated from the destructive distillation of indigo in 1826 by Otto Unverdorben. In 1834, Friedrich Runge isolated from coal tar a substance which produced a beautiful blue color on treatment with chloride of lime; this he named kyanol or cyanol. In 1841, C. J. Fritzsche showed that by treating indigo with caustic potash it yielded an oil, which he named aniline, from the specific name of one of the indigo-yielding plants, Indigofera anil, anil being derived from the Sanskrit, dark-blue.\nSee also: Aniline hydrochloride (is active moiety of) ...

        "text1": "Title: Malic Acid\nwikipedia: Malic acid is an organic compound with the molecular formula HO2CCH(OH)CH2CO2H. It is a dicarboxylic acid that is made by all living organisms, contributes to the sour taste of fruits, and is used as a food additive. Malic acid has two stereoisomeric forms (L- and D-enantiomers), though only the L-isomer exists naturally. The salts and esters of malic acid are known as malates. The malate anion is a metabolic intermediate in the citric acid cycle.\n\nEtymology: The word 'malic' is derived from Latin m\u0101lum, meaning 'apple'. The related Latin word m\u0101lus, meaning 'apple tree', is used as the name of the genus Malus, which includes all apples and crabapples; and is the origin of other taxonomic classifications such as Maloideae, Malinae, and Maleae.\n\nBiochemistry: L-Malic acid is the naturally occurring form, whereas a mixture of L- and D-malic acid is produced synthetically.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\nMalate plays an important role in biochemistry. In the C4 carbon fixation process, malate is a source of CO2 in the Calvin cycle. In the citric acid cycle, (S)-malate is an intermediate, formed by the addition of an -OH group on the si face of fumarate. It can also be formed from pyruvate via anaplerotic reactions.\nMalate is also synthesized by the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate in the guard cells of plant leaves. Malate, as a double anion, often accompanies potassium cations during the uptake of solutes into the guard cells in order to maintain electrical balance in the cell. The accumulation of these solutes within the guard cell decreases the solute potential, allowing water to enter the cell and promote aperture of the stomata.\n\nIn food: Malic acid was first isolated from apple juice by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1785. Antoine Lavoisier in 1787 proposed the name acide malique, which is derived from the Latin word for apple, m\u0101lum\u2014as is its genus name Malus.\nIn German it is named \u00c4pfels\u00e4ure (or Apfels\u00e4ure) after plural or singular of a sour thing from the apple fruit, but the salt(s) are called Malat(e).\nMalic acid is the main acid in many fruits, including apricots, blackberries, blueberries, cherries, grapes, mirabelles, peaches, pears, plums, and quince, and is present in lower concentrations in other fruits, such as citrus. It contributes to the sourness of unripe apples. Sour apples contain high proportions of the acid. It is present in grapes and in most wines with concentrations sometimes as high as 5 g/L. It confers a tart taste to wine; the amount decreases with increasing fruit ripeness. The taste of malic acid is very clear and pure in rhubarb, a plant for which it is the primary flavor. It is also the compound responsible for the tart flavor of sumac spice. It is also a component of some artificial vinegar flavors, such as \"salt and vinegar\" flavored potato chips.\nThe process of malolactic fermentation converts malic acid to much milder lactic acid. Malic acid occurs naturally in all fruits and many vegetables, and is generated in fruit metabolism.\nMalic acid, when added to food products, is denoted by E number E296. It is sometimes used with or in place of the less sour citric acid in sour sweets. These sweets are sometimes labeled with a warning stating that excessive consumption can cause irritation of the mouth. It is approved for use as a food additive in the EU, US and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed by its INS number 296).\nMalic acid contains 10 kJ (2.39 kilocalories) of energy per gram.\n\nProduction and main reactions: Racemic malic acid is produced industrially by the double hydration of maleic anhydride. In 2000, American production capacity was 5,000 tons per year. The enantiomers may be separated by chiral resolution of the racemic mixture. S-Malic acid is obtained by fermentation of fumaric acid.\nSelf-condensation of malic acid in the presence of fuming sulfuric acid gives the pyrone coumalic acid:\n\n2 HO2CCH(OH)CH2CO2H  \u2192   HO2CC4H3O2  +  2 CO  +  4 H2O\nCarbon monoxide and water are liberated during this reaction.\nMalic acid was important in the discovery of the Walden inversion and the Walden cycle, in which (\u2212)-malic acid first is converted into (+)-chlorosuccinic acid by action of phosphorus pentachloride. Wet silver oxide then converts the chlorine compound to (+)-malic acid, which then reacts with PCl5 to the (\u2212)-chlorosuccinic acid. The cycle is completed when silver oxide takes this compound back to (\u2212)-malic acid.\nL-malic acid is used to resolve \u03b1-phenylethylamine, a versatile resolving agent in its own right.\n\nPlant defense: Soil supplementation with molasses increases microbial synthesis of malic acid. This is thought to occur naturally as part of soil microbe suppression of disease, so soil amendment with molasses can be used as a crop treatment in horticulture.\n\nInteractive pathway map: Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles.\n\nSee also: Acids in wine\nCitrate\u2013malate shuttle\nCrassulacean acid metabolism\nMalate\u2013aspartate shuttle\nMaleic acid, resulting from malic acid dehydration\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Calculator: Water and solute activities in aqueous malic acid\n\n\n pubchem:\nMalic acid is a 2-hydroxydicarboxylic acid that is succinic acid in which one of the hydrogens attached to a carbon is replaced by a hydroxy group. It has a role as a food acidity regulator and a fundamental metabolite. It is a 2-hydroxydicarboxylic acid and a C4-dicarboxylic acid. It is functionally related to a succinic acid. It is a conjugate acid of a malate(2-) and a malate.\nMalic acid has been used in trials studying the treatment of Xerostomia, Depression, and Hypertension.\nMalic acid has been reported in Camellia sinensis, Solanum tuberosum, and other organisms with data available.\nMALIC ACID is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV.\nSee also: Hibiscus sabdariffa Flower (part of) ...

The enantiopure (absolute configuration S) version of this compound is an intermediate to launched retroviral drugs.\n\nSynthesis: 3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran was prepared in 1910 by Pariselle via cyclization and hydrolysis of 3,4-Dibromo-1-methoxybutane. Chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (both (S) \u2013 and (R)-forms) has been synthesized in high enantiomeric purity from (S)- and (R)-1,2,4-butanetriol, respectively, obtained from chiral feedstocks. Thus, the chiral (S)-1,2,4-butanetriol intermediate was cyclized to chiral (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) catalyst at temperatures of 180\u2212220 \u00b0C.  \nSimilarly, (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran was prepared in 95.8% optical purity from L-malic acid via an esterification-reduction-cyclodehydration sequence. 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran has been synthesized via hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofuran employing various borane reagents and chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurans have also been prepared by catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofurans with a borane in the presence of a homogeneous chiral platinum complex, followed by oxidation. Racemic 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran may be prepared in analogous fashion from racemic butanetriol, employing PTSA catalyst for the dehydrocyclization. Alternatively, 1,2,4-butanetriol may be converted to 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran by treating with ethylene carbonate, followed by pyrolysis of the resulting carbonate ester.\n\nApplications: 3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran is an intermediate to the AIDS drugs amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Additionally, 3-OH THF has been an intermediate to developmental drug substances, such as chemotherapy agents. For example, reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran has been used in the synthesis of bis(O,O-di(tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)hydrogen dithiophosphate)platinum(II), a cisplatin analog. 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran may be converted into a range of tetrahydrofuran derivatives, many of which also serve as intermediates to compounds of pharmaceutical interest. For example, tetrahydrofuran-3-one (3-ketotetrahydrofuran) and 3-aminotetrahydrofuran have been synthesized from 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran and used in pharmaceutical syntheses. Additionally, additive amounts (0.05-0.15 weight %) of the nitrate ester manufactured by sulfuric acid-nitric acid nitration of 3-hydoxytetrahydrofuran have been found to increase the quality (cetane number) of diesel fuel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nsafety: Irritant\nsmiles: C1COCC1O\nforumla: C4H8O2\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 88.11 g/mol\nXLogP3: -0.4\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 1\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 2\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\nExact Mass: 88.052429494 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 88.052429494 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 29.5\nHeavy Atom Count: 6\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 44.8\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 1\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

Upon prolonged exposure to aqueous solutions phlorizin hydrolyzes to phloretin and glucose.\n\nOccurrence: Phlorizin is found primarily in unripe Malus (apple) root bark of apple, and trace amounts have been found in strawberry. In Malus, it is most abundant in vegetative tissues (such as leaves and bark) and seeds.

In natural sources, it may occur with other polyphenols such as quercetin, catechin, epicatechin, procyanidins, and rutin.\n\nPharmacology: Phlorizin is an inhibitor of SGLT1 and SGLT2 because it competes with D-glucose for binding to the carrier; this action reduces renal glucose transport, lowering the amount of glucose in the blood. Phlorizin was studied as a potential pharmaceutical treatment for type 2 diabetes, but has since been superseded by more selective and more promising synthetic analogs, such as empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin.

Similar to melatonin, 6-OHM is a full agonist of the MT1 and MT2 receptors. It is also an antioxidant and neuroprotective, and is even more potent in this regard relative to melatonin.\n\nRole in metabolism: The determination of 6-OHM in human urine has been used to track the metabolism and excretion of melatonin using LC-MS/MS, providing quantifiable insights into circadian rhythm regulation and its oxidative role as a biomarker. 6-OHM is one of four of the primary metabolic products of melatonin in the liver and is also a byproduct of its breakdown due to exposure to light. It is known to be very effective in protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

        "text2": "Title: Melatonin\nwikipedia: Melatonin, an indoleamine, is a natural compound produced by various organisms, including bacteria and eukaryotes. Its discovery in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner and colleagues stemmed from the isolation of a substance from the pineal gland of cows that could induce skin lightening in common frogs. This compound was later identified as a hormone secreted in the brain during the night, playing a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm, in vertebrates.\nIn vertebrates, melatonin's functions extend to synchronizing sleep-wake cycles, encompassing sleep-wake timing and blood pressure regulation, as well as controlling seasonal rhythmicity (circannual cycle), which includes reproduction, fattening, molting, and hibernation. Its effects are mediated through the activation of melatonin receptors and its role as an antioxidant. In plants and bacteria, melatonin primarily serves as a defense mechanism against oxidative stress, indicating its evolutionary significance. The mitochondria, key organelles within cells, are the main producers of antioxidant melatonin, underscoring the molecule's \"ancient origins\" and its fundamental role in protecting the earliest cells from reactive oxygen species.\n\nIn addition to its endogenous functions as a hormone and antioxidant, melatonin is also administered exogenously as a dietary supplement and medication. It is utilized in the treatment of sleep disorders, including insomnia and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders.\n\nBiological activity: In humans, melatonin primarily acts as a potent full agonist of two types of melatonin receptors: melatonin receptor 1, with picomolar binding affinity, and melatonin receptor 2, with nanomolar binding affinity. Both receptors are part of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) family, specifically the Gi/o alpha subunit GPCRs, although melatonin receptor 1 also exhibits coupling with Gq alpha subunit.\nFurthermore, melatonin functions as a high-capacity antioxidant, or free radical scavenger, within mitochondria, playing a dual role in combating cellular oxidative stress. First, it directly neutralizes free radicals, and second, it promotes the gene expression of essential antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase. This increase in antioxidant enzyme expression is mediated through signal transduction pathways activated by the binding of melatonin to its receptors. Through these mechanisms, melatonin protects the cell against oxidative stress in two ways, and plays other roles in human health than only regulating the sleep-wake cycle.\n\nBiological functions: \n\nCircadian rhythm: In mammals, melatonin is critical for the regulation of sleep\u2013wake cycles, or circadian rhythms. The establishment of regular melatonin levels in human infants occurs around the third month after birth, with peak concentrations observed between midnight and 8:00 am. It has been documented that melatonin production diminishes as a person ages. Additionally, a shift in the timing of melatonin secretion is observed during adolescence, resulting in delayed sleep and wake times, increasing their risk for delayed sleep phase disorder during this period.\nThe antioxidant properties of melatonin were first recognized in 1993. In vitro studies reveal that melatonin directly neutralizes various reactive oxygen species, including hydroxyl (OH\u2022), superoxide (O2\u2212\u2022), and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide (NO\u2022).  In plants, melatonin works synergistically with other antioxidants, enhancing the overall effectiveness of each antioxidant. This compound has been found to be twice as efficacious as vitamin E, a known potent lipophilic antioxidant, in combating oxidative stress. The promotion of antioxidant enzyme expression, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and catalase, is mediated through melatonin receptor-triggered signal transduction pathways.\nMelatonin's concentration in the mitochondrial matrix is significantly higher than that found in the blood plasma,  emphasizing its role not only in direct free radical scavenging but also in modulating the expression of antioxidant enzymes and maintaining mitochondrial integrity. This multifaceted role shows the physiological significance of melatonin as a mitochondrial antioxidant, a notion supported by numerous scholars.\nFurthermore, the interaction of melatonin with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species results in the formation of metabolites capable of reducing free radicals. These metabolites, including cyclic 3-hydroxymelatonin, N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AFMK), and N1-acetyl-5-methoxykynuramine (AMK), contribute to the broader antioxidative effects of melatonin through further redox reactions with free radicals.\n\nImmune system: Melatonin's interaction with the immune system is recognized, yet the specifics of these interactions remain inadequately defined. An anti-inflammatory effect appears to be the most significant. The efficacy of melatonin in disease treatment has been the subject of limited trials, with most available data deriving from small-scale, preliminary studies. It is posited that any beneficial immunological impact is attributable to melatonin's action on high-affinity receptors (MT1 and MT2), which are present on immunocompetent cells. Preclinical investigations suggest that melatonin may augment cytokine production and promote the expansion of T cells, thereby potentially mitigating acquired immunodeficiencies.\n\nWeight regulation: Melatonin's potential to regulate weight gain is posited to involve its inhibitory effect on leptin, a hormone that serves as a long-term indicator of the body's energy status. Leptin is important for regulating energy balance and body weight by signaling satiety and reducing food intake. Melatonin, by modulating leptin's actions outside of waking hours, may contribute to the restoration of leptin sensitivity during daytime, thereby counteracting leptin resistance.\n\nBiochemistry: \n\nBiosynthesis: The biosynthesis of melatonin in animals involves a sequence of enzymatic reactions starting with L-tryptophan, which can be synthesized through the shikimate pathway from chorismate, found in plants, or obtained from protein catabolism. The initial step in the melatonin biosynthesis pathway is the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan's indole ring by the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, resulting in the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Subsequently, 5-HTP undergoes decarboxylation, facilitated by pyridoxal phosphate and the enzyme 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase, yielding serotonin.\nSerotonin, an essential neurotransmitter, is further converted into N-acetylserotonin by the action of serotonin N-acetyltransferase, utilizing acetyl-CoA. The final step in the pathway involves the methylation of N-acetylserotonin's hydroxyl group by hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase, with S-adenosyl methionine as the methyl donor, to produce melatonin.\nIn bacteria, protists, fungi, and plants, the synthesis of melatonin also involves tryptophan as an intermediate but originates indirectly from the shikimate pathway. The pathway commences with D-erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and in photosynthetic cells, additionally involves carbon dioxide. While the subsequent biosynthetic reactions share similarities with those in animals, there are slight variations in the enzymes involved in the final stages.\nThe hypothesis that melatonin synthesis occurs within mitochondria and chloroplasts suggests an evolutionary and functional significance of melatonin in cellular energy metabolism and defense mechanisms against oxidative stress, reflecting the molecule's ancient origins and its multifaceted roles across different domains of life.\n\nMechanism: The mechanism of melatonin biosynthesis initiates with the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan, a process that requires the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) to react with oxygen and the active site iron of tryptophan hydroxylase. Although the complete mechanism is not entirely understood, two main mechanisms have been proposed:\nThe first mechanism involves a slow transfer of one electron from THB to molecular oxygen (O2), potentially producing a superoxide (O\u22122). This superoxide could then recombine with the THB radical to form 4a-peroxypterin. 4a-peroxypterin may either react with the active site iron (II) to create an iron-peroxypterin intermediate or directly transfer an oxygen atom to the iron, facilitating the hydroxylation of L-tryptophan.\nAlternatively, the second mechanism proposes that oxygen interacts with the active site iron (II) first, forming iron (III) superoxide. This molecule could then react with THB to form an iron-peroxypterin intermediate.\nFollowing the formation of iron (IV) oxide from the iron-peroxypterin intermediate, this oxide selectively attacks a double bond to yield a carbocation at the C5 position of the indole ring. A subsequent 1,2-shift of the hydrogen and the loss of one of the two hydrogen atoms on C5 would restore aromaticity, producing 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan.\nThe decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan to produce 5-hydroxytryptamine is then facilitated by a decarboxylase enzyme with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. PLP forms an imine with the amino acid derivative, facilitating the breaking of the carbon\u2013carbon bond and release of carbon dioxide. The protonation of the amine derived from tryptophan restores the aromaticity of the pyridine ring, leading to the production of 5-hydroxytryptamine and PLP.\nSerotonin N-acetyltransferase, with histidine residue His122, is hypothesized to deprotonate the primary amine of 5-hydroxytryptamine. This deprotonation allows the lone pair on the amine to attack acetyl-CoA, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. The thiol from coenzyme A then acts as a leaving group when attacked by a general base, producing N-acetylserotonin.\nThe final step in the biosynthesis of melatonin involves the methylation of N-acetylserotonin at the hydroxyl position by SAM, resulting in the production of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) and melatonin.\n\nRegulation: In vertebrates, the secretion of melatonin is regulated through the activation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor by the hormone norepinephrine. Norepinephrine increases the concentration of intracellular cAMP via beta-adrenergic receptors, which in turn activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AANAT), the penultimate enzyme in the melatonin synthesis pathway. When exposed to daylight, noradrenergic stimulation ceases, leading to the immediate degradation of the protein by proteasomal proteolysis. The production of melatonin recommences in the evening, a phase known as the dim-light melatonin onset.\nBlue light, especially within the 460\u2013480 nm range, inhibits the biosynthesis of melatonin, with the degree of suppression being directly proportional to the intensity and duration of light exposure. Historically, humans in temperate climates experienced limited exposure to blue daylight during winter months, primarily receiving light from sources that emitted predominantly yellow light, such as fires. The incandescent light bulbs used extensively throughout the 20th century emitted relatively low levels of blue light. It has been found that light containing only wavelengths greater than 530 nm does not suppress melatonin under bright-light conditions. The use of glasses that block blue light in the hours preceding bedtime can mitigate melatonin suppression. Additionally, wearing blue-blocking goggles during the last hours before bedtime is recommended for individuals needing to adjust to an earlier bedtime since melatonin facilitates the onset of sleep.\n\nMetabolism: Melatonin is metabolized with an elimination half-life ranging from 20 to 50 minutes. The primary metabolic pathway transforms melatonin into 6-hydroxymelatonin, which is then conjugated with sulfate and excreted in urine as a waste product. It is primarily metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A1, CYP2C19, and CYP1B1.\n\nMeasurement: For both research and clinical purposes, melatonin levels in humans can be determined through saliva or blood plasma analysis.\n\nUse as a medication and supplement: Melatonin is used both as a prescription medication and an over-the-counter dietary supplement for the management of sleep disorders, including insomnia and various circadian rhythm sleep disorders such as delayed sleep phase disorder, jet lag disorder, and shift work sleep disorder. In addition to melatonin, a range of synthetic melatonin receptor agonists, namely ramelteon, tasimelteon, and agomelatine, are used in medicine.\nA study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in April 2023 found that only 12% of the 30 melatonin gummy product preparations analyzed had melatonin quantities within \u00b110% of the amounts specified on their labels. Some gummy supplements were found to contain up to 347% of the declared melatonin content. In Europe, melatonin is classified as an active pharmaceutical ingredient, highlighting the regulatory oversight of its use and distribution. Conversely, as of 2022, the United States was considering the inclusion of melatonin in pharmacy compounding practices. A preceding study from 2022 concluded that consuming unregulated melatonin products can expose individuals, including children, to melatonin quantities ranging from 40 to 130 times higher than the recommended levels when products are used 'as directed'.\nAnecdotal reports and formal research studies over the past few decades have established a link between melatonin supplementation and more vivid dreams.\n\nHistory: \n\nDiscovery: Melatonin's discovery is linked to the study of skin color changes in some amphibians and reptiles, a phenomenon initially observed through the administration of pineal gland extracts. In 1917, Carey Pratt McCord and Floyd P. Allen found that feeding extracts from the pineal glands of cows caused the skin of tadpoles to lighten by contracting the dark epidermal melanophores.\nThe hormone melatonin was isolated in 1958 by Aaron B. Lerner, a dermatology professor, and his team at Yale University. Motivated by the possibility that a substance from the pineal gland could be beneficial in treating skin diseases, they extracted and identified melatonin from bovine pineal gland extracts. Subsequent research in the mid-1970s by Lynch and others demonstrated that melatonin production follows a circadian rhythm in human pineal glands.\nThe first patent for the therapeutic use of melatonin as a low-dose sleep aid was awarded to Richard Wurtman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995.\n\nEtymology: The etymology of melatonin stems from its skin-lightening properties. As detailed in their publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Lerner and his colleagues proposed the name melatonin, derived from the Greek words melas, meaning 'black' or 'dark', and tonos, meaning 'labour', 'colour' or 'suppress'. This naming convention follows that of serotonin, another agent affecting skin color, discovered in 1948 as a modulator of vascular tone, which influenced its name based on its serum vasoconstrictor effect. Melatonin was thus aptly named to reflect its role in preventing the darkening of the skin, highlighting the intersection of biochemistry and linguistics in scientific discovery.\n\nOccurrence: \n\nAnimals and Humans: In vertebrates, melatonin is produced in darkness, thus usually at night, by the pineal gland, a small endocrine gland\nlocated in the center of the brain but outside the blood\u2013brain barrier. Light/dark information reaches the suprachiasmatic nuclei  from retinal photosensitive ganglion cells of the eyes rather than the melatonin signal (as was once postulated). Known as \"the hormone of darkness\", the onset of melatonin at dusk promotes activity in nocturnal (night-active) animals and sleep in diurnal ones including humans.\nIn humans, ~30 \u03bcg of melatonin is produced daily and 80% of the total amount is produced in the night (W). The plasma maximum concentration of melatonin at night are 80\u2013120 pg/mL and the concentrations during the day are between 10\u201320 pg/mL.\nMany animals and humans use the variation in duration of melatonin production each day as a seasonal clock. In animals including humans, the profile of melatonin synthesis and secretion is affected by the variable duration of night in summer as compared to winter. The change in duration of secretion thus serves as a biological signal for the organization of daylength-dependent (photoperiodic) seasonal functions such as reproduction, behavior, coat growth, and camouflage coloring in seasonal animals. In seasonal breeders that do not have long gestation periods and that mate during longer daylight hours, the melatonin signal controls the seasonal variation in their sexual physiology, and similar physiological effects can be induced by exogenous melatonin in animals including mynah birds and hamsters. Melatonin can suppress libido by inhibiting secretion of luteinizing hormone  and follicle-stimulating hormone  from the anterior pituitary gland, especially in mammals that have a breeding season when daylight hours are long. The reproduction of long-day breeders is repressed by melatonin and the reproduction of short-day breeders is stimulated by melatonin. In sheep, melatonin administration has also shown antioxidant and immune-modulatory regime in prenatally stressed offspring helping them survive the crucial first days of their lives. \nDuring the night, melatonin regulates leptin, lowering its levels.\nCetaceans have lost all the genes for melatonin synthesis as well as those for melatonin receptors. This is thought to be related to their unihemispheric sleep pattern (one brain hemisphere at a time). Similar trends have been found in sirenians.\n\nPlants: Until its identification in plants in 1987, melatonin was for decades thought to be primarily an animal neurohormone. When melatonin was identified in coffee extracts in the 1970s, it was believed to be a byproduct of the extraction process. Subsequently, however, melatonin has been found in all plants that have been investigated. It is present in all the different parts of plants, including leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and seeds, in varying proportions. Melatonin concentrations differ not only among plant species, but also between varieties of the same species depending on the agronomic growing conditions, varying from picograms to several micrograms per gram. Notably high melatonin concentrations have been measured in popular beverages such as coffee, tea, wine, and beer, and crops including corn, rice, wheat, barley, and oats. In some common foods and beverages, including coffee and walnuts, the concentration of melatonin has been estimated or measured to be sufficiently high to raise the blood level of melatonin above daytime baseline values.\nAlthough a role for melatonin as a plant hormone has not been clearly established, its involvement in processes such as growth and photosynthesis is well established. Only limited evidence of endogenous circadian rhythms in melatonin levels has been demonstrated in some plant species and no membrane-bound receptors analogous to those known in animals have been described. Rather, melatonin performs important roles in plants as a growth regulator, as well as environmental stress protector. It is synthesized in plants when they are exposed to both biological stresses, for example, fungal infection, and nonbiological stresses such as extremes of temperature, toxins, increased soil salinity, drought, etc.\nHerbicide-induced oxidative stress has been experimentally mitigated in vivo in a high-melatonin transgenic rice. Studies conducted on lettuce grown in saline soil conditions have shown that the application of melatonin significantly mitigates the harmful effects of salinity. Foliar application increases the number of leaves, their surface area, increases fresh weight and the content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, and the content of carotenoids compared to plants not treated with melatonin.\nFungal disease resistance is another role. Added melatonin increases resistance in Malus prunifolia against Diplocarpon mali. Also acts as a growth inhibitor on fungal pathogens including Alternaria, Botrytis, and Fusarium spp. Decreases the speed of infection. As a seed treatment, protects Lupinus albus from fungi. Dramatically slows Pseudomonas syringae tomato DC3000 infecting Arabidopsis thaliana and infecting Nicotiana benthamiana.\n\nFungi: Melatonin has been observed to reduce stress tolerance in Phytophthora infestans in plant-pathogen systems. Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk have used genetically modified yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to produce melatonin.\n\nBacteria: Melatonin is produced by \u03b1-proteobacteria and photosynthetic cyanobacteria. There is no report of its occurrence in archaea which indicates that melatonin originated in bacteria most likely to prevent the first cells from the damaging effects of oxygen in the primitive Earth's atmosphere.\nNovo Nordisk have used genetically modified Escherichia coli to produce melatonin.\n\nArchaea: In 2022, the discovery of serotonin N-acetyltransferase (SNAT)\u2014the penultimate, rate-limiting enzyme in the melatonin biosynthetic pathway\u2014in the archaeon Thermoplasma volcanium  firmly places melatonin biosynthesis in all three major domains of life, dating back to ~4 Gya.\n\nFood products: Naturally-occurring melatonin has been reported in foods including tart cherries to about 0.17\u201313.46 ng/g, bananas, plums, grapes, rice, cereals, herbs, olive oil, wine, and beer. The consumption of milk and sour cherries may improve sleep quality. When birds ingest melatonin-rich plant feed, such as rice, the melatonin binds to melatonin receptors in their brains. When humans consume foods rich in melatonin, such as banana, pineapple, and orange, the blood levels of melatonin increase significantly.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \n\"Melatonin\".

Its use continues despite the rise of various accessible alternatives such as bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate with more precise action and less side effects.\n\nMedical uses: Spironolactone is used primarily to treat heart failure, edematous conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, low blood levels of potassium, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with liver cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). The most common use of spironolactone is in the treatment of heart failure. On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. The classification of spironolactone as a \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" has been described as obsolete. Spironolactone is also used to treat Bartter's syndrome due to its ability to raise potassium levels.\nSpironolactone has antiandrogenic activity. For this reason, it is used to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens play a role. Some of these uses include acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss in women. Spironolactone is used for the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. High doses of spironolactone, which are needed for considerable antiandrogenic effects, are not recommended for men due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Spironolactone can be used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as due to polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nHeart failure: While loop diuretics remain first-line for most people with heart failure, spironolactone has been shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality in numerous studies and remains an important agent for treating fluid retention, edema, and symptoms of heart failure. Current recommendations from the American Heart Association are to use spironolactone in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%.\nSpironolactone improves left ventricular diastolic function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, however it has no effect on mortality and hospitalization.\nDue to its antiandrogenic properties, spironolactone can cause effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any longer than a short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer medication, eplerenone, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related medication canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure.\n\nHigh blood pressure: About 1 in 100 people with hypertension have elevated levels of aldosterone; in these people, the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone may exceed that of complex combined regimens of other antihypertensives since it targets the primary cause of the elevated blood pressure. However, a Cochrane review found adverse effects at high doses and little effect on blood pressure at low doses in the majority of people with high blood pressure. There is no evidence of person-oriented outcome at any dose in this group.\n\nHigh aldosterone levels: Spironolactone is used in the treatment of hyperaldosteronism (high aldosterone levels or mineralocorticoid excess), for instance primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). Antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone and eplerenone are first-line treatments for hyperaldosteronism. They improve blood pressure and potassium levels, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, albuminuria, and carotid intima-media thickness, in people with primary aldosteronism. In people with hyperaldosteronism due to unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma, adrenalectomy should be preferred instead of antimineralocorticoids. Spironolactone should not be used to treat primary aldosteronism in pregnancy due to its antiandrogen-related risk of teratogenicity in male fetuses.\n\nSkin and hair conditions: Androgens like testosterone and DHT play a critical role in the pathogenesis of a number of dermatological conditions including oily skin, acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). In demonstration of this, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) do not produce sebum or develop acne and have little to no body, pubic, or axillary hair. Moreover, men with congenital 5\u03b1-reductase type II deficiency, 5\u03b1-reductase being an enzyme that greatly potentiates the androgenic effects of testosterone in the skin, have little to no acne, scanty facial hair, reduced body hair, and reportedly no incidence of male-pattern hair loss. Conversely, hyperandrogenism in women, for instance due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is commonly associated with acne and hirsutism as well as virilization (masculinization) in general. In accordance with the preceding, antiandrogens are highly effective in the treatment of the aforementioned androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions.\nBecause of the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, it can be quite effective in treating acne in women. In addition, spironolactone reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin and can be used to treat oily skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of spironolactone to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered to be one of the beneficial side effects and has been quite successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, spironolactone is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. Spironolactone has been reported to produce a 50 to 100% improvement in acne at sufficiently high doses. Response to treatment generally requires 1 to 3 months in the case of acne and up to 6 months in the case of hirsutism. Ongoing therapy is generally required to avoid relapse of symptoms. Spironolactone is commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, and is considered to be a first-line antiandrogen for this indication. Spironolactone can be used in the treatment of female-pattern hair loss (pattern scalp hair loss in women). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, not all cases of female-pattern hair loss are dependent on androgens.\nAntiandrogens like spironolactone are male-specific teratogens which can feminize male fetuses due to their antiandrogenic effects. For this reason, it is recommended that antiandrogens only be used to treat women who are of reproductive age in conjunction with adequate contraception. Oral contraceptives, which contain an estrogen and a progestin, are typically used for this purpose. Moreover, oral contraceptives themselves are functional antiandrogens and are independently effective in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions, and hence can significantly augment the effectiveness of antiandrogens in the treatment of such conditions.\nSpironolactone is not generally used in men for the treatment of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly. As an example, spironolactone has been reported to reduce symptoms of acne in males. An additional example is the usefulness of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender women and nonbinary individuals.\nTopical spironolactone is effective in the treatment of acne as well. As a result, topical pharmaceutical formulations containing 2% or 5% spironolactone cream became available in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism in the early 1990s. The products were discontinued in 2006 when the creams were added to the list of doping substances with a decree of the Ministry of Health that year.\n\nComparison: Spironolactone, the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor finasteride, and the nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide all appear to have similar effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism. However, some clinical research has found that the effectiveness of spironolactone for hirsutism is greater than that of finasteride but is less than that of flutamide. The combination of spironolactone with finasteride is more effective than either alone for hirsutism and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill is more effective than a birth control pill alone. One study showed that spironolactone or the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate both in combination with a birth control pill had equivalent effectiveness for hirsutism. Spironolactone is considered to be a first-line treatment for hirsutism, finasteride and the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate are considered to be second-line treatments, and flutamide is no longer recommended for hirsutism due to liver toxicity concerns. The nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is an alternative option to flutamide with improved safety.\nThe combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill in the treatment of acne appears to have similar effectiveness to a birth control pill alone and the combination of a birth control pill with cyproterone acetate, flutamide, or finasteride. However, this was based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. Spironolactone may be more effective than birth control pills in the treatment of acne, and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill may have greater effectiveness for acne than either alone. In addition, some clinical research has found that flutamide is more effective than spironolactone in the treatment of acne. In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within 3 months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same period. However, the use of flutamide for acne is limited by its liver toxicity. Bicalutamide is a potential alternative to flutamide for acne as well. Spironolactone can be considered as a first-line treatment for acne in those who have failed other standard treatments such as topical therapies and under certain other circumstances, although this is controversial due to the side effects of spironolactone and its teratogenicity.\nThere is insufficient clinical evidence to compare the effectiveness of spironolactone with other antiandrogens for female-pattern hair loss. The effectiveness of spironolactone in the treatment of both acne and hirsutism appears to be dose-dependent, with higher doses being more effective than lower doses. However, higher doses also have greater side effects, such as menstrual irregularities.\n\nTransgender hormone therapy: Despite paradoxical reactions, spironolactone is used off-label as a component of feminizing hormone therapy in transgender women, especially in the United States (where cyproterone acetate is not available), usually in addition to an estrogen. Alternatives like bicalutamide do not have a similar level of popularity. As spironolactone's antiandrogenic effect appears only in high doses, it can have a wide array of side effects not found in antiandrogens working more exclusively on the androgen receptor. When coupled with estradiol, effects in transgender women include decreased male pattern body hair, induction of breast development and of feminization in general, and reduced spontaneous erections.\n\nForms: Spironolactone is available in the form of tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg; brand name Aldactone, others) and suspensions (25 mg/5 mL; brand name Carospir) for use by mouth. It has also been marketed in the form of 2% and 5% topical cream in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism under the brand name Spiroderm, but this product is no longer available. The medication is also available in combination with other medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide (brand name Aldactazide, others). Spironolactone has poor water solubility, and for this reason, only oral and topical formulations have been developed; other routes of administration such as intravenous injection are not used. The only antimineralocorticoid that is available as a solution for parenteral use is the related medication potassium canrenoate.\n\nContraindications: Contraindications of spironolactone include hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), severe and end-stage kidney disease (due to high hyperkalemia risk, except possibly in those on dialysis), Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency and low aldosterone levels), and concomitant use of eplerenone. It should also be used with caution in people with certain neurological disorders, as well as those who experience or have experienced anuria (lack of urine production), acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of kidney excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia.\n\nSide effects: One of the most common side effects of spironolactone is frequent urination. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because of its antiandrogenic activity, spironolactone can cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), feminization in general, and demasculinization, as well as sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction, although these side effects are usually confined to high doses of spironolactone. At very high doses (400 mg/day), spironolactone has also been associated with testicular atrophy and reversibly reduced fertility, including semen abnormalities such as decreased sperm count and motility in cis men. However, such doses of spironolactone are rarely used clinically. In cis women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement. Aside from these adverse effects, the side effects of spironolactone in women taking high doses are minimal, and it is well tolerated.\nA potential side effect of spironolactone is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia can present as a normal anion-gap metabolic acidosis. It has been reported that the addition of spironolactone to loop diuretics in people with heart failure was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Spironolactone may put people at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and gastritis. In addition, there has been some evidence suggesting an association between use of the medication and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, spironolactone is immunosuppressive in the treatment of sarcoidosis.\nMost of the side effects of spironolactone are dose-dependent. Low-dose spironolactone is generally very well tolerated. Even higher doses of spironolactone, such as 100 mg/day, are well tolerated in most individuals. Dose-dependent side effects of spironolactone include menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and enlargement, orthostatic hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The side effects of spironolactone are usually mild and rarely result in discontinuation.\n\nHigh potassium levels: Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia, or high blood potassium levels. Rarely, this can be fatal. Of people with heart disease prescribed typical dosages of spironolactone, 10 to 15% develop some degree of hyperkalemia, and 6% develop severe hyperkalemia. At a higher dosage, a rate of hyperkalemia of 24% has been observed. An abrupt and major increase in the rate of hospitalization due to hyperkalemia from 0.2% to 11% and in the rate of death due to hyperkalemia from 0.3 per 1,000 to 2.0 per 1,000 between early 1994 and late 2001 has been attributed to a parallel rise in the number of prescriptions written for spironolactone upon the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) in July 1999. However, another population-based study in Scotland failed to replicate these findings. The risk of hyperkalemia with spironolactone is greatest in the elderly, in people with renal impairment (e.g., due to chronic kidney disease or diabetic nephropathy), in people taking certain other medications (including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the antibiotic trimethoprim, and potassium supplements), and at higher dosages of spironolactone.\nAlthough spironolactone poses an important risk of hyperkalemia in the elderly, in those with kidney or cardiovascular disease, and/or in those taking medications or supplements which increase circulating potassium levels, a large retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in young women without such characteristics who had been treated with high doses of spironolactone for dermatological conditions did not differ from that of controls. This was the conclusion of a 2017 hybrid systematic review of studies of spironolactone for acne in women as well, which found that hyperkalemia was rare and was invariably mild and clinically insignificant. These findings suggest that hyperkalemia may not be a significant risk in such individuals, and that routine monitoring of circulating potassium levels may be unnecessary in this population. However, other sources have claimed that hyperkalemia can nonetheless also occur in people with more normal renal function and presumably without such risk factors. Occasional testing on a case-by-case basis in those with known risk factors may be justified. Side effects of spironolactone which may be indicative of hyperkalemia and if persistent could justify serum potassium testing include nausea, fatigue, and particularly muscle weakness. Notably, non-use of routine potassium monitoring with spironolactone in young women would reduce costs associated with its use.\nAmong young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone, hyperkalemia is rare and (if present) transient and asymptomatic. Larger doses do not appear to increase risks in this population. A broader retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in gender-diverse individuals is correlated with age, with those above 45 years old being more at risk. The finding suggests that patients below or at 45 years old without other conditions that affect potassium handling can be spared from routine monitoring.\n\nBreast changes: Spironolactone can cause breast pain and breast enlargement in women. This is \"probably because of estrogenic effects on target tissue.\" At low doses, breast tenderness has been reported in only 5% of women, but at high doses, it has been reported in up to 40% of women. Breast enlargement and tenderness may occur in 26% of women at high doses. Some women regard spironolactone-induced breast enlargement as a positive effect.\nSpironolactone also commonly and dose-dependently produces gynecomastia (breast development) as a side effect in men. At low doses, the rate is only 5 to 10%, but at high doses, up to or exceeding 50% of men may develop gynecomastia. In the RALES, 9.1% of men taking 25 mg/day spironolactone developed gynecomastia, compared to 1.3% of controls. Conversely, in studies of healthy men given high-dose spironolactone, gynecomastia occurred in 3 of 10 (30%) at 100 mg/day, in 5 of 8 (62.5%) at 200 mg/day, and in 6 of 9 (66.7%) at 400 mg/day, relative to none of 12 controls. The severity of gynecomastia with spironolactone varies considerably, but is usually mild. As with breast enlargement caused by spironolactone in women, gynecomastia due to spironolactone in men is often although inconsistently accompanied by breast tenderness. In the RALES, only 1.7% of men developed breast pain, relative to 0.1% of controls.\nThe time to onset of spironolactone-induced gynecomastia has been found to be 27 \u00b1 20 months at low doses and 9 \u00b1 12 months at high doses. Gynecomastia induced by spironolactone usually regresses after a few weeks following discontinuation of the medication. However, after a sufficient duration of gynecomastia being present (e.g., one year), hyalinization and fibrosis of the tissue occurs and drug-induced gynecomastia may become irreversible.\n\nMenstrual disturbances: Spironolactone at higher doses can cause menstrual irregularities as a side effect in women. These irregularities include metrorrhagia (intermenstrual bleeding), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and breakthrough bleeding. They are common during spironolactone therapy, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses and almost all experiencing them at a high doses. For example, about 20% of women experienced menstrual irregularities with 50 to 100 mg/day spironolactone, whereas about 70% experienced menstrual irregularities at 200 mg/day. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular and anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) in large percentages of women, as well as with polymenorrhea (short menstrual cycles). The medication reportedly has no birth control effect.\nIt has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17\u03b1-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels. Indeed, CYP17A1 genotype is associated with polymenorrhea. Regardless of their mechanism, the menstrual disturbances associated with spironolactone can usually be controlled well by concomitant treatment with a birth control pill, due to the progestin component.\n\nMood changes: Research is mixed on whether antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone have positive or negative effects on mood. In any case, it is possible that spironolactone might have the capacity to increase the risk of depressive symptoms. However, a 2017 hybrid systematic review found that the incidence of depression in women treated with spironolactone for acne was less than 1%. Likewise, a 10-year observational study found that the incidence of depression in 196 transgender women taking high-dose spironolactone in combination with an estrogen was less than 1%.\n\nLipid changes: Spironolactone has been found to increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and decrease HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels at the relatively high doses used in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). As such, it may have unfavorable effects on the blood lipid profile in this context. Heightened LDL cholesterol levels are a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. Consequently, it has been said that spironolactone should not be given to women with dyslipidemia (e.g., high cholesterol). Unfavorable lipid changes have also been seen with other antiandrogens, like cyproterone acetate and bicalutamide.\n\nRare reactions: Aside from hyperkalemia, spironolactone may rarely cause adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis, kidney failure, hepatitis (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases of breast cancer in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported.\n\nSpironolactone bodies: Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of \"spironolactone bodies\" in the adrenal cortex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding: Spironolactone can cross the placenta. It has been found to be present in the breast milk of lactating mothers. However, only very small amounts of spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone enter breast milk, and the amount received by an infant during breastfeeding (<0.5% of the mother's dose) is considered to be insignificant.\nA study found that spironolactone was not associated with teratogenicity in the offspring of rats. Because it is an antiandrogen, however, spironolactone could theoretically have the potential to cause feminization of male fetuses at sufficient doses. In accordance, a subsequent study found that partial feminization of the genitalia occurred in the male offspring of rats that received doses of spironolactone that were five times higher than those normally used in humans (200 mg/kg per day). Another study found permanent, dose-related reproductive tract abnormalities rat offspring of both sexes at lower doses (50 to 100 mg/kg per day).\nIn practice however, although experience is limited, spironolactone has never been reported to cause observable feminization or any other congenital defects in humans. Among 31 human newborns exposed to spironolactone in the first trimester, there were no signs of any specific birth defects. A case report described a woman who was prescribed spironolactone during pregnancy with triplets and delivered all three (one boy and two girls) healthy; there was no feminization in the boy. In addition, spironolactone has been used at high doses to treat pregnant women with Bartter's syndrome, and none of the infants (three boys, two girls) showed toxicity, including feminization in the male infants. There are similar findings, albeit also limited, for another antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate (prominent genital defects in male rats, but no human abnormalities (including feminization of male fetuses) at both a low dose of 2 mg/day or high doses of 50 to 100 mg/day). In any case, spironolactone is nonetheless not recommended during pregnancy due to theoretical concerns relating to feminization of males and also to potential alteration of fetal potassium levels.\nA 2019 systematic review found insufficient evidence that spironolactone causes birth defects in humans. However, there was also insufficient evidence to be certain that it does not.\n\nOverdose: Spironolactone is relatively safe in acute overdose. Symptoms following an acute overdose of spironolactone may include drowsiness, confusion, maculopapular or erythematous rash, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and diarrhea. In rare cases, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or hepatic coma may occur in individuals with severe liver disease. However, these adverse reactions are unlikely in the event of an acute overdose. Hyperkalemia can occur following an overdose of spironolactone, and this is especially so in people with decreased kidney function. Spironolactone has been studied at extremely high oral doses of up to 2,400 mg per day in clinical trials. Its oral median lethal dose (LD50) is more than 1,000 mg/kg in mice, rats, and rabbits.\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose of spironolactone. Treatment may consist of induction of vomiting or stomach evacuation by gastric lavage. The treatment of spironolactone overdose is supportive, with the purpose of maintaining hydration, electrolyte balance, and vital functions. Spironolactone should be discontinued in people with impaired kidney function or hyperkalemia.\n\nInteractions: Spironolactone often increases serum potassium levels and can cause hyperkalemia, a very serious condition. Therefore, it is recommended that people using this medication avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Physicians must be careful to monitor potassium levels in both males and females who are taking spironolactone as a diuretic, especially during the first twelve months of use and whenever the dosage is increased. Doctors may also recommend that some patients may be advised to limit dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods. However, recent data suggests that both potassium monitoring and dietary restriction of potassium intake is unnecessary in healthy young women taking spironolactone for acne and in healthy young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone for hormone therapy. Spironolactone together with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole increases the likelihood of hyperkalemia, especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the nephron.\nSpironolactone has been reported to induce the enzymes CYP3A4 and certain UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which can result in interactions with various medications. However, it has also been reported that metabolites of spironolactone irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4. In any case, spironolactone has been found to reduce the bioavailability of oral estradiol, which could be due to induction of estradiol metabolism via CYP3A4. Spironolactone has also been found to inhibit UGT2B7. Spironolactone can also have numerous other interactions, most commonly with other cardiac and blood pressure medications, for instance digoxin.\nLicorice, which has indirect mineralocorticoid activity by inhibiting mineralocorticoid metabolism, has been found to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone. Moreover, the addition of licorice to spironolactone has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of spironolactone in women treated with it for hyperandrogenism, and licorice hence may be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with spironolactone as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On the opposite end of the spectrum, spironolactone is useful in reversing licorice-induced hypokalemia. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been found to attenuate the diuresis and natriuresis induced by spironolactone, but, not to affect its antihypertensive effect.\nSome research has suggested that spironolactone might be able to interfere with the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment. As the medication acts as an antimineralocorticoid, it is thought that it might be able to reduce the effectiveness of certain antidepressants by interfering with normalization of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and by increasing levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol. However, other research contradicts this hypothesis and has suggested that spironolactone might produce antidepressant effects. For instance, studies showing antidepressant-like effects of spironolactone in animals.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: The pharmacodynamics of spironolactone are characterized by high antimineralocorticoid activity, moderate antiandrogenic activity, and weak steroidogenesis inhibition, among other more minor activities. Spironolactone is a prodrug, so most of its actions are actually mediated by its various active metabolites. The major active forms of spironolactone are 7\u03b1-thiomethylspironolactone (7\u03b1-TMS) and canrenone (7\u03b1-desthioacetyl-\u03b46-spironolactone).\nSpironolactone is a potent antimineralocorticoid. That is, it is an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the biological target of mineralocorticoids like aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. By blocking the MR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of mineralocorticoids in the body. The antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone is responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of edema, high blood pressure, heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, and ascites due to cirrhosis. It is also responsible for many of the side effects of spironolactone, such as urinary frequency, dehydration, hyponatremia, low blood pressure, fatigue, dizziness, metabolic acidosis, decreased kidney function, and its risk of hyperkalemia. Due to the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone, levels of aldosterone are significantly increased by the medication, probably reflecting an attempt of the body to maintain homeostasis.\nSpironolactone is a moderate antiandrogen. That is, it is an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). By blocking the AR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of androgens in the body. The antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone is mainly responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and hyperandrogenism in women, precocious puberty in boys with testotoxicosis, and as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It is also primarily responsible for some of its side effects, like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, feminization, and demasculinization in men. Blockade of androgen signaling in the breast disinhibits the actions of estrogens in this tissue. Although useful as an antiandrogen in women, who have low testosterone levels compared to men, spironolactone is described as having relatively weak antiandrogenic activity.\nSpironolactone is a weak steroidogenesis inhibitor. That is, it inhibits steroidogenic enzymes, or enzymes involved in the production of steroid hormones. Spironolactone and/or its metabolites have been found in vitro to weakly inhibit a broad array of steroidogenic enzymes including cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17\u03b1-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, 5\u03b1-reductase, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11\u03b2-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase, and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase). However, although very high doses of spironolactone can considerably decrease steroid hormone levels in animals, spironolactone has shown mixed and inconsistent effects on steroid hormone levels in clinical studies, even at high clinical doses. In any case, the levels of most steroid hormones, including testosterone and cortisol, are usually unchanged by spironolactone in humans, which may in part be related to compensatory upregulation of their synthesis. The weak steroidogenesis inhibition of spironolactone might contribute to its antiandrogenic efficacy to some degree and may explain its side effect of menstrual irregularities in women. However, its androgen synthesis inhibition is probably clinically insignificant.\nSpironolactone has been found in some studies to increase levels of estradiol, an estrogen, although many other studies have found no changes in estradiol levels. The mechanism of how spironolactone increases estradiol levels is unclear, but it may involve inhibition of the inactivation of estradiol into estrone and enhancement of the peripheral conversion of testosterone into estradiol. It is notable that spironolactone has been found in vitro to act as a weak inhibitor of 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, an enzyme that is involved in the conversion of estradiol into estrone. Increased levels of estradiol with spironolactone may be involved in its preservation of bone density and in its side effects such as breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and gynecomastia in women and men.\nIn response to the antimineralocorticoid activity spironolactone, and in an attempt to maintain homeostasis, the body increases aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex. Some studies have found that levels of cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone that is also produced in the adrenal cortex, are increased as well. Spironolactone \u201cacts at the basolateral side of the upper-distal tubule as well as in the collecting tubule,\u201d and does not have glucocorticoid-like effects at these specific sites; it can sometimes be prescribed as an alternative to glucocorticoids for patients with Glucocorticoid-Remediable Aldosteronism characterized by aldosterone excess, In patients \u201creceiving spironolactone, there was a significant positive correlation between the change in cortisol and the change in HbA1c (r = 0.489, P = .003).\u201d Patients taking spironolactone must be monitored for side effects including dizziness, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.\nOther activities of spironolactone may include very weak interactions with the estrogen and progesterone receptors and agonism of the pregnane X receptor. These activities could contribute to the menstrual irregularities and breast side effects of spironolactone and to its drug interactions, respectively.\n\nPharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of spironolactone have not been studied well, which is in part because it is an old medication that was developed in the 1950s. Nonetheless, much has been elucidated about the pharmacokinetics of spironolactone over the decades.\n\nAbsorption: The bioavailability of spironolactone when taken by mouth is 60 to 90%. The bioavailability of spironolactone and its metabolites increases significantly (+22\u201395% increases in levels) when spironolactone is taken with food, although it is uncertain whether this further increases the therapeutic effects of the medication. The increase in bioavailability is thought to be due to promotion of the gastric dissolution and absorption of spironolactone, as well as due to a decrease of the first-pass metabolism. The relationship between a single dose of spironolactone and plasma levels of canrenone, a major active metabolite of spironolactone, has been found to be linear across a dose range of 25 to 200 mg spironolactone. Steady-state concentrations of spironolactone are achieved within 8 to 10 days of treatment initiation.\nLittle or no systemic absorption has been observed with topical spironolactone.\n\nDistribution: Spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone are highly plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. Spironolactone is bound equivalently to albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, while canrenone is bound only to albumin. Spironolactone and its metabolite 7\u03b1-thiospironolactone show very low or negligible affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In accordance, a study of high-dosage spironolactone treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), suggesting that spironolactone does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins. This is in contradiction with widespread statements that spironolactone increases free estradiol levels by displacing estradiol from SHBG.\nSpironolactone appears to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier.\n\nMetabolism: Spironolactone is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver upon oral administration and has a very short terminal half-life of 1.4 hours. The major metabolites of spironolactone are 7\u03b1-thiomethylspironolactone (7\u03b1-TMS), 6\u03b2-hydroxy-7\u03b1-thiomethylspironolactone (6\u03b2-OH-7\u03b1-TMS), and canrenone (7\u03b1-desthioacetyl-\u03b46-spironolactone). These metabolites have much longer elimination half-lives than spironolactone of 13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively, and are responsible for the therapeutic effects of the medication. As such, spironolactone is a prodrug. The 7\u03b1-thiomethylated metabolites of spironolactone were not known for many years and it was originally thought that canrenone was the major active metabolite of the medication, but subsequent research identified 7\u03b1-TMS as the major metabolite. Other known but more minor metabolites of spironolactone include 7\u03b1-thiospironolactone (7\u03b1-TS), which is an important intermediate to the major metabolites of spironolactone, as well as the 7\u03b1-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone and the 6\u03b2-hydroxy-7\u03b1-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone.\nSpironolactone is hydrolyzed or deacetylated at the thioester of the C7\u03b1 position into 7\u03b1-TS by carboxylesterases. Following formation of 7\u03b1-TS, it is S-oxygenated by flavin-containing monooxygenases to form an electrophilic sulfenic acid metabolite. This metabolite is involved in the CYP450 inhibition of spironolactone, and also binds covalently to other proteins. 7\u03b1-TS is also S-methylated into 7\u03b1-TMS, a transformation catalyzed by thiol S-methyltransferase. Unlike the related medication eplerenone, spironolactone is said to not be metabolized by CYP3A4. However, hepatic CYP3A4 is likely responsible for the 6\u03b2-hydroxylation of 7\u03b1-TMS into 6\u03b2-OH-7\u03b1-TMS. 7\u03b1-TMS may also be hydroxylated at the C3\u03b1 and C3\u03b2 positions. Spironolactone is dethioacetylated into canrenone. Finally, the C17 \u03b3-lactone ring of spironolactone is hydrolyzed by the paraoxonase PON3. It was originally thought to be hydrolyzed by PON1, but this was due to contamination with PON3.\n\nElimination: The majority of spironolactone is eliminated by the kidneys, while minimal amounts are handled by biliary excretion.\n\nChemistry: Spironolactone, also known as 7\u03b1-acetylthiospirolactone, is a steroidal 17\u03b1-spirolactone, or more simply a spirolactone. It can most appropriately be conceptualized as a derivative of progesterone, itself also a potent antimineralocorticoid, in which a hydroxyl group has been substituted at the C17\u03b1 position (as in 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone), the acetyl group at the C17\u03b2 position has been cyclized with the C17\u03b1 hydroxyl group to form a spiro 21-carboxylic acid \u03b3-lactone ring, and an acetylthio group has been substituted in at the C7\u03b1 position. These structural modifications of progesterone confer increased oral bioavailability and potency, potent antiandrogenic activity, and strongly reduced progestogenic activity. The C7\u03b1 substitution is likely responsible for or involved in the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, as 7\u03b1-thioprogesterone (SC-8365), unlike progesterone, is an antiandrogen with similar affinity to the AR as that of spironolactone. In addition, the C7\u03b1 substitution appears to be responsible for the loss of progestogenic activity and good oral bioavailability of spironolactone, as SC-5233, the analogue of spironolactone without a C7\u03b1 substitution, has potent progestogenic activity but very poor oral bioavailability similarly to progesterone.\n\nNames: Spironolactone is also known by the following equivalent chemical names:\n\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-17\u03b1-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid \u03b3-lactone\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-3-oxo-17\u03b1-pregn-4-ene-21,17\u03b2-carbolactone\n3-(3-Oxo-7\u03b1-acetylthio-17\u03b2-hydroxyandrost-4-en-17\u03b1-yl)propionic acid lactone\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-17\u03b1-(2-carboxyethyl)androst-4-en-17\u03b2-ol-3-one \u03b3-lactone\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-17\u03b1-(2-carboxyethyl)testosterone \u03b3-lactone\n\nAnalogues: Spironolactone is closely related structurally to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, as well as to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7\u03b1-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).\n\nSynthesis: Chemical syntheses of spironolactone and its analogues and derivatives have been described and reviewed.\n\nHistory: The natriuretic effects of progesterone were demonstrated in 1955, and the development of spironolactone as a synthetic antimineralocorticoid analogue of progesterone shortly followed this. Spironolactone was first synthesized in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. Gynecomastia was first reported with spironolactone in 1962, and the antiandrogenic activity of the medication was first described in 1969. This shortly followed the discovery in 1967 that gynecomastia is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. Spironolactone was first studied in the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1978. It has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for dermatological indications in women in the United States. Spironolactone was first studied as an antiandrogen in transgender women in 1986, and has since become widely adopted for this purpose as well, particularly in the United States where cyproterone acetate is not available.\nEarly oral spironolactone tablets showed poor absorption. The formulation was eventually changed to a micronized formulation with particle sizes of less than 50 \u03bcg, which resulted in approximately 4-fold increased potency.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nGeneric names: The English, French, and generic name of the medication is spironolactone and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip D\u00e9nomination Commune Fran\u00e7aise, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its name is spironolactonum in Latin, Spironolacton in German, espironolactona in Spanish and Portuguese, and spironolattone in Italian (which is also its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana).\nSpironolactone is also known by its developmental code names SC-9420 and NSC-150339.\n\nBrand names: Spironolactone is marketed under various brand names throughout the world. The original brand name of spironolactone is Aldactone. Other brand names include Aldactone-A, Berlactone, CaroSpir, Espironolactona, Espironolactona Genfar, Novo-Spiroton, Prilactone (veterinary), Spiractin, Spiridon, Spirix, Spiroctan, Spiroderm (discontinued), Spirogamma, Spirohexal, Spirolon, Spirolone, Spiron, Spironolactone Actavis, Spironolactone Orion, Spironolactone Teva, Spirotone, Tempora (veterinary), Uractone, Uractonum, Verospiron, and Vivitar.\nSpironolactone is also formulated in combination with a variety of other medications, including with hydrochlorothiazide as Aldactazide, with hydroflumethiazide as Aldactide, Lasilacton, Lasilactone, and Spiromide, with altizide as Aldactacine and Aldactazine, with furosemide as Fruselac, with benazepril as Cardalis (veterinary), with metolazone as Metolactone, with bendroflumethiazide as Sali-Aldopur, and with torasemide as Dytor Plus, Torlactone, and Zator Plus.\n\nAvailability: Spironolactone is marketed throughout the world.\n\nResearch: \n\nProstate conditions: Spironolactone has been studied at a high dosage in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate). It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, it has been said that spironolactone has no place in the treatment of BPH.\nSpironolactone has been studied and used limitedly in the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus: Spironolactone has been found to block Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) production and that of other human herpesviruses by inhibiting the function of an EBV protein SM, which is essential for infectious virus production. This effect of spironolactone was determined to be independent of its antimineralocorticoid actions.\n\nOther conditions: Spironolactone has been studied in the treatment of rosacea in both males and females.\nSpironolactone has been studied in fibromyalgia in women. It has also been studied in bulimia nervosa in women, but was not found to be effective.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nEthanethioic acid S-(10,13-dimethyl-3,5'-dioxo-7-spiro[2,6,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16-decahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-17,2'-oxolane]yl) ester is a steroid lactone.\nA potassium sparing diuretic that acts by antagonism of aldosterone in the distal renal tubules.

        "text2": "Title: Hydroquinone\nwikipedia: Hydroquinone, also known as benzene-1,4-diol or quinol, is an aromatic organic compound that is a type of phenol, a derivative of benzene, having the chemical formula C6H4(OH)2. It has two hydroxyl groups bonded to a benzene ring in a para position. It is a white granular solid. Substituted derivatives of this parent compound are also referred to as hydroquinones. The name \"hydroquinone\" was coined by Friedrich W\u00f6hler in 1843.\nIn 2022, it was the 268th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions.\n\nProduction: Hydroquinone is produced industrially in two main ways.\n\nThe most widely used route is similar to the cumene process in reaction mechanism and involves the dialkylation of benzene with propene to give 1,4-diisopropylbenzene. This compound reacts with air to afford the bis(hydroperoxide), which is structurally similar to cumene hydroperoxide and rearranges in acid to give acetone and hydroquinone.\nA second route involves hydroxylation of phenol over a catalyst. The conversion uses hydrogen peroxide and affords a mixture of hydroquinone and its ortho isomer catechol (benzene-1,2-diol):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              5\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          OH\n          +\n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            O\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \u27f6\n          \n            C\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              4\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              (\n              OH\n              )\n            \n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          O\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\ce {C6H5OH + H2O2 -> C6H4(OH)2 + H2O}}}\n  \n\nOther, less common methods include:\n\nA potentially significant synthesis of hydroquinone from acetylene and iron pentacarbonyl has been proposed Iron pentacarbonyl serves as a catalyst, rather than as a reagent, in the presence of free carbon monoxide gas. Rhodium or ruthenium can substitute for iron as the catalyst with favorable chemical yields but are not typically used due to their cost of recovery from the reaction mixture.\nHydroquinone and its derivatives can also be prepared by oxidation of various phenols, such as aniline and DIPB. Examples include Elbs persulfate oxidation and Dakin oxidation.\nHydroquinone was first obtained in 1820 by the French chemists Pelletier and Caventou via the dry distillation of quinic acid.\nHydrolysis of chlorinated phenol, described as being used in China.\nNote that methods such as hydrolysis of chlorinated phenol and oxidation of phenols are much more polluting methods than some others.\n\nReactions: The reactivity of hydroquinone's hydroxyl groups resembles that of other phenols, being weakly acidic. The resulting conjugate base undergoes easy O-alkylation to give mono- and diethers. Similarly, hydroquinone is highly susceptible to ring substitution by Friedel\u2013Crafts reactions such as alkylation. This reaction is exploited en route to popular antioxidants such as 2-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol (BHA). The useful dye quinizarin is produced by diacylation of hydroquinone with phthalic anhydride.\n\nRedox: Hydroquinone undergoes oxidation under mild conditions to give benzoquinone. This process can be reversed. Some naturally occurring hydroquinone derivatives exhibit this sort of reactivity, one example being coenzyme Q. Industrially this reaction is exploited both with hydroquinone itself but more often with its derivatives where one OH has been replaced by an amine.\nWhen colorless hydroquinone and benzoquinone, a bright yellow solid, are cocrystallized in a 1:1 ratio, a dark-green crystalline charge-transfer complex (melting point 171 \u00b0C) called quinhydrone (C6H6O2\u00b7C6H4O2) is formed. This complex dissolves in hot water, where the two molecules dissociate in solution.\n\nAmination: An important reaction is the conversion of hydroquinone to the mono- and diamine derivatives. Methylaminophenol, used in photography, is produced in this way:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              4\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              (\n              OH\n              )\n            \n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  CH\n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  NH\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              methylamine\n            \n          \n          \u27f6\n          \n            HOC\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              4\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            NHCH\n            \n              3\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          O\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\ce {C6H4(OH)2 + {\\overset {methylamine}{CH3NH2}}-> HOC6H4NHCH3 + H2O}}}\n  \n\nDiamines, useful in the rubber industry as antiozone agents, are similarly produced from aniline:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            C\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              4\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              (\n              OH\n              )\n            \n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          \n            \n              \n                2\n                \n                \n                  C\n                  \n                    6\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  H\n                  \n                    5\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  NH\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                  \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              aniline\n            \n          \n          \u27f6\n          \n            C\n            \n              6\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              4\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              (\n              N\n              \n                (\n                H\n                )\n              \n              \n                C\n                \n                  6\n                \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                H\n                \n                  5\n                \n                \n                  \n                \n              \n              )\n            \n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          +\n          2\n          \n          \n            H\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          O\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\ce {C6H4(OH)2 + {\\overset {aniline}{2 C6H5NH2}}-> C6H4(N(H)C6H5)2 + 2 H2O}}}\n\nUses: Hydroquinone has a variety of uses principally associated with its action as a reducing agent that is soluble in water. It is a major component in most black and white photographic developers for film and paper where, with the compound metol, it reduces silver halides to elemental silver.\nThere are various other uses associated with its reducing power. As a polymerisation inhibitor, exploiting its antioxidant properties, hydroquinone prevents polymerization of acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, cyanoacrylate, and other monomers that are susceptible to radical-initiated polymerization. By acting as a free radical scavenger, hydroquinone serves to prolong the shelflife of light-sensitive resins such as preceramic polymers.\nHydroquinone can lose a hydrogen cation from both hydroxyl groups to form a diphenolate ion. The disodium diphenolate salt of hydroquinone is used as an alternating comonomer unit in the production of the polymer PEEK.\n\nSkin depigmentation: Hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin. It does not have the same predisposition to cause dermatitis as metol does. This is a prescription-only ingredient in some countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directives 76/768/EEC:1976.\nIn 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations. The FDA officially banned hydroquinone in 2020 as part of a larger reform of the over-the-counter drug review process. The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen. This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis (variation in nuclei sizes), mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell adenomas. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns.\nNumerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone, if taken orally, can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin; however, skin preparations containing the ingredient are administered topically. The FDA had classified hydroquinone in 1982 as a safe product - generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE), however additional studies under the National Toxicology Program (NTP) were suggested in order to determine whether there is a risk to humans from the use of hydroquinone. NTP evaluation showed some evidence of long-term carcinogenic and genotoxic effects\nWhile hydroquinone remains widely prescribed for treatment of hyperpigmentation, questions raised about its safety profile by regulatory agencies in the EU, Japan, and USA encourage the search for other agents with comparable efficacy. Several such agents are already available or under research, including azelaic acid, kojic acid, retinoids, cysteamine, topical steroids, glycolic acid, and other substances. One of these, 4-butylresorcinol, has been proved to be more effective at treating melanin-related skin disorders by a wide margin, as well as safe enough to be made available over the counter.\nIn the anthraquinone process substituted hydroquinones, typically anthrahydroquinone are used to produce hydrogen peroxide which forms spontaneously on reaction with oxygen. The type of substituted hydroquinone is selected depending on reactivity and recyclability.\n\nNatural occurrences: Hydroquinones are one of the two primary reagents in the defensive glands of bombardier beetles, along with hydrogen peroxide (and perhaps other compounds, depending on the species), which collect in a reservoir. The reservoir opens through a muscle-controlled valve onto a thick-walled reaction chamber. This chamber is lined with cells that secrete catalases and peroxidases. When the contents of the reservoir are forced into the reaction chamber, the catalases and peroxidases rapidly break down the hydrogen peroxide and catalyze the oxidation of the hydroquinones into p-quinones. These reactions release free oxygen and generate enough heat to bring the mixture to the boiling point and vaporize about a fifth of it, producing a hot spray from the beetle's abdomen.\nHydroquinone is thought to be the active toxin in Agaricus hondensis mushrooms.\nHydroquinone has been shown to be one of the chemical constituents of the natural product propolis.\nIt is also one of the chemical compounds found in castoreum. This compound is gathered from the beaver's castor sacs.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: International Chemical Safety Card 0166\nNIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards\n\n\n pubchem:\nHydroquinone appears as light colored crystals or solutions. May irritate the skin, eyes and mucous membranes. Mildly toxic by ingestion or skin absorption.\nHydroquinone is a benzenediol comprising benzene core carrying two hydroxy substituents para to each other. It has a role as a cofactor, a carcinogenic agent, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a human xenobiotic metabolite, a skin lightening agent, an antioxidant and a mouse metabolite. It is a benzenediol and a member of hydroquinones.\nHydroquinone is a topical lightening product found in  OTC products, and is used to correct skin discoloration associated with disorders of hyperpigmentation including melasma, post-inflammatory hyperpigmention, sunspots, and freckles. It can be used alone, but is more frequently found in combination with other agents such as alpha-hydroxy acids, corticosteroids, retinoids, or sunscreen.    Hydroquinone has come under scrutiny due to several complications associated with its use, including dermal irritation, exogenous onchronosis, and carginogenicity. As a result of these concerns, hydroquinone has been banned in the EU and UK.\nHydroquinone is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\nHydroquinone is used as a developing agent in photography and as an antioxidant in rubber and food. Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, erosion of the gastric mucosa, edema of internal organs, cyanosis, convulsions, delirium, and collapse may result from the ingestion of a large amount of hydroquinone in humans. Hydroquinone is also a skin irritant in humans. Chronic (long-term) occupational exposure to hydroquinone dust can result in eye irritation, corneal effects, and impaired vision. No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of hydroquinone in humans. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in orally-exposed rodents. Increased skin tumor incidence has been reported in mice treated dermally. EPA has not classified hydroquinone for carcinogenicity.\nHydroquinone is a Melanin Synthesis Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of hydroquinone is as a Melanin Synthesis Inhibitor. The physiologic effect of hydroquinone is by means of Depigmenting Activity.\nHydroquinone has been reported in Spiranthes vernalis, Phomopsis velata, and other organisms with data available.\nHydroquinone is produced as an inhibitor, an antioxidant, and an intermediate in the synthesis of dyes, motor fuels, and oils; in photographic processing; and naturally in certain plant species, Hydroquinone is a phenol derivative with antioxidant properties that can cause toxicity in several organs, notably the kidney. Used as a topical treatment for skin hyperpigmentation and in various cosmetic products, it is metabolized mainly to glutathione conjugates and forms mutagenic DNA adducts in in-vitro systems. (NCI04)\nHYDROQUINONE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 2002 and is indicated for hyperpigmentation of the skin and freckles.\nHydroquinone, also benzene-1,4-diol, is an aromatic organic compound which is a type of phenol. Hydroquinone is commonly used as a biomarker for benzene exposure. The presence of hydroquinone in normal individuals stems mainly from direct dietary ingestion, catabolism of tyrosine and other substrates by gut bacteria, ingestion of arbutin containing foods, cigarette smoking, and the use of some over-the-counter medicines. In human medicine, hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations. The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen.

Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin, if taken orally; however, skin preparations containing the ingredient are administered topically. The FDA has classified hydroquinone currently as a safe product, as currently used.

It has stimulant effects in animals with similar potency to caffeine.

        "text2": "Title: Caffeine\nwikipedia: Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class and is the most commonly consumed psychoactive substance globally. It is mainly used for its eugeroic (wakefulness promoting), ergogenic (physical performance-enhancing), or nootropic (cognitive-enhancing) properties. Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine at a number of adenosine receptor types, inhibiting the centrally depressant effects of adenosine and enhancing the release of acetylcholine. Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine, which allows it to bind and block its receptors. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase, increases calcium release from intracellular stores, and antagonizes GABA receptors, although these mechanisms typically occur at concentrations beyond usual human consumption.\nCaffeine is a bitter, white crystalline purine, a methylxanthine alkaloid, and is chemically related to the adenine and guanine bases of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). It is found in the seeds, fruits, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to Africa, East Asia and South America and helps to protect them against herbivores and from competition by preventing the germination of nearby seeds, as well as encouraging consumption by select animals such as honey bees. The best-known source of caffeine is the coffee bean, the seed of the Coffea plant. People may drink beverages containing caffeine to relieve or prevent drowsiness and to improve cognitive performance. To make these drinks, caffeine is extracted by steeping the plant product in water, a process called infusion. Caffeine-containing drinks, such as coffee, tea, and cola, are consumed globally in high volumes. In 2020, almost 10 million tonnes of coffee beans were consumed globally. Caffeine is the world's most widely consumed psychoactive drug. Unlike most other psychoactive substances, caffeine remains largely unregulated and legal in nearly all parts of the world. Caffeine is also an outlier as its use is seen as socially acceptable in most cultures with it even being encouraged.\nCaffeine has both positive and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases, including Parkinson's disease. Some people experience sleep disruption or anxiety if they consume caffeine, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit caffeine to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less. Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence \u2013 associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability \u2013 when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake. Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use).\nCaffeine is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as generally recognized as safe. Toxic doses, over 10 grams per day for an adult, are much higher than the typical dose of under 500 milligrams per day. The European Food Safety Authority reported that up to 400 mg of caffeine per day (around 5.7 mg/kg of body mass per day) does not raise safety concerns for non-pregnant adults, while intakes up to 200 mg per day for pregnant and lactating women do not raise safety concerns for the fetus or the breast-fed infants. A cup of coffee contains 80\u2013175 mg of caffeine, depending on what \"bean\" (seed) is used, how it is roasted, and how it is prepared (e.g., drip, percolation, or espresso). Thus it requires roughly 50\u2013100 ordinary cups of coffee to reach the toxic dose. However, pure powdered caffeine, which is available as a dietary supplement, can be lethal in tablespoon-sized amounts.\n\nUses: \n\nMedical: Caffeine is used for both prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in premature infants. It may improve weight gain during therapy and reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy as well as reduce language and cognitive delay. On the other hand, subtle long-term side effects are possible.\nCaffeine is used as a primary treatment for apnea of prematurity, but not prevention. It is also used for orthostatic hypotension treatment.\nSome people use caffeine-containing beverages such as coffee or tea to try to treat their asthma. Evidence to support this practice is poor. It appears that caffeine in low doses improves airway function in people with asthma, increasing forced expiratory volume (FEV1) by 5% to 18% for up to four hours. \nThe addition of caffeine (100\u2013130 mg) to commonly prescribed pain relievers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen modestly improves the proportion of people who achieve pain relief.\nConsumption of caffeine after abdominal surgery shortens the time to recovery of normal bowel function and shortens length of hospital stay.\nCaffeine was formerly used as a second-line treatment for ADHD. It is considered less effective than methylphenidate or amphetamine but more so than placebo for children with ADHD. Children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD are more likely to consume caffeine, perhaps as a form of self-medication.\n\nEnhancing performance: \n\nCognitive performance: Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that may reduce fatigue and drowsiness. At normal doses, caffeine has variable effects on learning and memory, but it generally improves reaction time, wakefulness, concentration, and motor coordination. The amount of caffeine needed to produce these effects varies from person to person, depending on body size and degree of tolerance. The desired effects arise approximately one hour after consumption, and the desired effects of a moderate dose usually subside after about three or four hours.\nCaffeine can delay or prevent sleep and improves task performance during sleep deprivation. Shift workers who use caffeine make fewer mistakes that could result from drowsiness.\nCaffeine in a dose dependent manner increases alertness in both fatigued and normal individuals.\nA systematic review and meta-analysis from 2014 found that concurrent caffeine and L-theanine use has synergistic psychoactive effects that promote alertness, attention, and task switching; these effects are most pronounced during the first hour post-dose.\n\nPhysical performance: Caffeine is a proven ergogenic aid in humans. Caffeine improves athletic performance in aerobic (especially endurance sports) and anaerobic conditions. Moderate doses of caffeine (around 5 mg/kg) can improve sprint performance, cycling and running time trial performance, endurance (i.e., it delays the onset of muscle fatigue and central fatigue), and cycling power output. Caffeine increases basal metabolic rate in adults. Caffeine ingestion prior to aerobic exercise increases fat oxidation, particularly in persons with low physical fitness.\nCaffeine improves muscular strength and power, and may enhance muscular endurance. Caffeine also enhances performance on anaerobic tests. Caffeine consumption before constant load exercise is associated with reduced perceived exertion.  While this effect is not present during exercise-to-exhaustion exercise, performance is significantly enhanced.  This is congruent with caffeine reducing perceived exertion, because exercise-to-exhaustion should end at the same point of fatigue. Caffeine also improves power output and reduces time to completion in aerobic time trials, an effect positively (but not exclusively) associated with longer duration exercise.\n\nSpecific populations: \n\nAdults: For the general population of healthy adults, Health Canada advises a daily intake of no more than 400 mg. This limit was found to be safe by a 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology.\n\nChildren: In healthy children, moderate caffeine intake under 400 mg produces effects that are \"modest and typically innocuous\". As early as six months old, infants can metabolize caffeine at the same rate as that of adults. Higher doses of caffeine (>400 mg) can cause physiological, psychological and behavioral harm, particularly for children with psychiatric or cardiac conditions. There is no evidence that coffee stunts a child's growth. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that caffeine consumption, particularly in the case of energy and sports drinks, is not appropriate for children and adolescents and should be avoided. This recommendation is based on a clinical report released by American Academy of Pediatrics in 2011 with a review of 45 publications from 1994 to 2011 and includes inputs from various stakeholders (Pediatricians, Committee on nutrition, Canadian Pediatric Society, Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, Sports Medicine & Fitness committee, National Federations of High School Associations). For children age 12 and under, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 2.5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. Based on average body weights of children, this translates to the following age-based intake limits:\n\nAdolescents: Health Canada has not developed advice for adolescents because of insufficient data. However, they suggest that daily caffeine intake for this age group be no more than 2.5 mg/kg body weight. This is because the maximum adult caffeine dose may not be appropriate for light-weight adolescents or for younger adolescents who are still growing. The daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight would not cause adverse health effects in the majority of adolescent caffeine consumers. This is a conservative suggestion since older and heavier-weight adolescents may be able to consume adult doses of caffeine without experiencing adverse effects.\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding: The metabolism of caffeine is reduced in pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and the half-life of caffeine during pregnancy can be increased up to 15 hours (as compared to 2.5 to 4.5 hours in non-pregnant adults). Evidence regarding the effects of caffeine on pregnancy and for breastfeeding are inconclusive. There is limited primary and secondary advice for, or against, caffeine use during pregnancy and its effects on the fetus or newborn.\nThe UK Food Standards Agency has recommended that pregnant women should limit their caffeine intake, out of prudence, to less than 200 mg of caffeine a day \u2013 the equivalent of two cups of instant coffee, or one and a half to two cups of fresh coffee. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) concluded in 2010 that caffeine consumption is safe up to 200 mg per day in pregnant women. For women who breastfeed, are pregnant, or may become pregnant, Health Canada recommends a maximum daily caffeine intake of no more than 300 mg, or a little over two 8 oz (237 mL) cups of coffee. A 2017 systematic review on caffeine toxicology found evidence supporting that caffeine consumption up to 300 mg/day for pregnant women is generally not associated with adverse reproductive or developmental effect.\nThere are conflicting reports in the scientific literature about caffeine use during pregnancy. A 2011 review found that caffeine during pregnancy does not appear to increase the risk of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation even when consumed in moderate to high amounts. Other reviews, however, concluded that there is some evidence that higher caffeine intake by pregnant women may be associated with a higher risk of giving birth to a low birth weight baby, and may be associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss. A systematic review, analyzing the results of observational studies, suggests that women who consume large amounts of caffeine (greater than 300 mg/day) prior to becoming pregnant may have a higher risk of experiencing pregnancy loss.\n\nAdverse effects: \n\nPhysiological: Caffeine in coffee and other caffeinated drinks can affect gastrointestinal motility and gastric acid secretion. In postmenopausal women, high caffeine consumption can accelerate bone loss. Caffeine, alongside other factors such as stress and fatigue, can also increase the pressure in various muscles, including the eyelids.\nAcute ingestion of caffeine in large doses (at least 250\u2013300 mg, equivalent to the amount found in 2\u20133 cups of coffee or 5\u20138 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived of caffeine for a period of days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users of caffeine develop a tolerance to this effect and experience no increase in urinary output.\n\nPsychological: Minor undesired symptoms from caffeine ingestion not sufficiently severe to warrant a psychiatric diagnosis are common and include mild anxiety, jitteriness, insomnia, increased sleep latency, and reduced coordination. Caffeine can have negative effects on anxiety disorders. According to a 2011 literature review, caffeine use may induce anxiety and panic disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety. For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly reduce anxiety. \nIn moderate doses, caffeine has been associated with reduced symptoms of depression and lower suicide risk. Two reviews indicate that increased consumption of coffee and caffeine may reduce the risk of depression.\nSome textbooks state that caffeine is a mild euphoriant, while others state that it is not a euphoriant.\nCaffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of the DSM-5 diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder.\n\nReinforcement disorders: \n\nAddiction: Whether caffeine can result in an addictive disorder depends on how addiction is defined.  Compulsive caffeine consumption under any circumstances has not been observed, and caffeine is therefore not generally considered addictive. However, some diagnostic models, such as the ICDM-9 and ICD-10, include a classification of caffeine addiction under a broader diagnostic model. Some state that certain users can become addicted and therefore unable to decrease use even though they know there are negative health effects.\nCaffeine does not appear to be a reinforcing stimulus, and some degree of aversion may actually occur, with people preferring placebo over caffeine in a study on drug abuse liability published in an NIDA research monograph. Some state that research does not provide support for an underlying biochemical mechanism for caffeine addiction. Other research states it can affect the reward system.\n\"Caffeine addiction\" was added to the ICDM-9 and ICD-10. However, its addition was contested with claims that this diagnostic model of caffeine addiction is not supported by evidence. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5 does not include the diagnosis of a caffeine addiction but proposes criteria for the disorder for more study.\n\nDependence and withdrawal: Withdrawal can cause mild to clinically significant distress or impairment in daily functioning.  The frequency at which this occurs is self-reported at 11%, but in lab tests only half of the people who report withdrawal actually experience it, casting doubt on many claims of dependence. and most cases of caffeine withdrawal were 13% in the moderate sense. Moderately physical dependence and withdrawal symptoms may occur upon abstinence, with greater than 100 mg caffeine per day, although these symptoms last no longer than a day. Some symptoms associated with psychological dependence may also occur during withdrawal.  The diagnostic criteria for caffeine withdrawal require a previous prolonged daily use of caffeine. Following 24 hours of a marked reduction in consumption, a minimum of 3 of these signs or symptoms is required to meet withdrawal criteria: difficulty concentrating, depressed mood/irritability, flu-like symptoms, headache, and fatigue. Additionally, the signs and symptoms must disrupt important areas of functioning and are not associated with effects of another condition.\nThe ICD-11 includes caffeine dependence as a distinct diagnostic category, which closely mirrors the DSM-5's proposed set of criteria for \"caffeine-use disorder\".  Caffeine use disorder refers to dependence on caffeine characterized by failure to control caffeine consumption despite negative physiological consequences. The APA, which published the DSM-5, acknowledged that there was sufficient evidence in order to create a diagnostic model of caffeine dependence for the DSM-5, but they noted that the clinical significance of the disorder is unclear.  Due to this inconclusive evidence on clinical significance, the DSM-5 classifies caffeine-use disorder as a \"condition for further study\".\nTolerance to the effects of caffeine occurs for caffeine-induced elevations in blood pressure and the subjective feelings of nervousness.  Sensitization, the process whereby effects become more prominent with use, may occur for positive effects such as feelings of alertness and wellbeing. Tolerance varies for daily, regular caffeine users and high caffeine users. High doses of caffeine (750 to 1200 mg/day spread throughout the day) have been shown to produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects of caffeine. Doses as low as 100 mg/day, such as a 6 oz (170 g) cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz (340 g) servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.\n\nRisk of other diseases: A neuroprotective effect of caffeine against Alzheimer's disease and dementia is possible but the evidence is inconclusive.\nCaffeine may lessen the severity of acute mountain sickness if taken a few hours prior to attaining a high altitude. One meta analysis has found that caffeine consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Regular caffeine consumption may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease and may slow the progression of Parkinson's disease.\nCaffeine increases intraocular pressure in those with glaucoma but does not appear to affect normal individuals.\nThe DSM-5 also includes other caffeine-induced disorders consisting of caffeine-induced anxiety disorder, caffeine-induced sleep disorder and unspecified caffeine-related disorders. The first two disorders are classified under \"Anxiety Disorder\" and \"Sleep-Wake Disorder\" because they share similar characteristics. Other disorders that present with significant distress and impairment of daily functioning that warrant clinical attention but do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed under any specific disorders are listed under \"Unspecified Caffeine-Related Disorders\".\n\nEnergy crash: Caffeine is reputed to cause a fall in energy several hours after drinking, but this is not well researched.\n\nOverdose: Consumption of 1\u20131.5 grams (1,000\u20131,500 mg) per day is associated with a condition known as caffeinism. Caffeinism usually combines caffeine dependency with a wide range of unpleasant symptoms including nervousness, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and palpitations after caffeine use.\nCaffeine overdose can result in a state of central nervous system overstimulation known as caffeine intoxication, a clinically significant temporary condition that develops during, or shortly after, the consumption of caffeine. This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400\u2013500 mg at a time). According to the DSM-5, caffeine intoxication may be diagnosed if five (or more) of the following symptoms develop after recent consumption of caffeine: restlessness, nervousness, excitement, insomnia, flushed face, diuresis, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, rambling flow of thought and speech, tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia, periods of inexhaustibility, and psychomotor agitation.\nAccording to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), cases of very high caffeine intake (e.g. > 5 g) may result in caffeine intoxication with symptoms including mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations or psychosis, and rhabdomyolysis.\n\nEnergy drinks: High caffeine consumption in energy drinks (at least one liter or 320 mg of caffeine) was associated with short-term cardiovascular side effects including hypertension, prolonged QT interval, and heart palpitations. These cardiovascular side effects were not seen with smaller amounts of caffeine consumption in energy drinks (less than 200 mg).\n\nSevere intoxication: As of 2007 there is no known antidote or reversal agent for caffeine intoxication. Treatment of mild caffeine intoxication is directed toward symptom relief; severe intoxication may require peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, or hemofiltration. Intralipid infusion therapy is indicated in cases of imminent risk of cardiac arrest in order to scavenge the free serum caffeine.\n\nLethal dose: Death from caffeine ingestion appears to be rare, and most commonly caused by an intentional overdose of medications. In 2016, 3702 caffeine-related exposures were reported to Poison Control Centers in the United States, of which 846 required treatment at a medical facility, and 16 had a major outcome; and several caffeine-related deaths are reported in case studies.  The LD50 of caffeine in rats is 192 milligrams per kilogram of body mass. The fatal dose in humans is estimated to be 150\u2013200 milligrams per kilogram, which is 10.5\u201314 grams for a typical 70 kg (150 lb) adult, equivalent to about 75\u2013100 cups of coffee. There are cases where doses as low as 57 milligrams per kilogram have been fatal. A number of fatalities have been caused by overdoses of readily available powdered caffeine supplements, for which the estimated lethal amount is less than a tablespoon. The lethal dose is lower in individuals whose ability to metabolize caffeine is impaired due to genetics or chronic liver disease. A death was reported in 2013 of a man with liver cirrhosis who overdosed on caffeinated mints.\n\nInteractions: Caffeine is a substrate for CYP1A2, and interacts with many substances through this and other mechanisms.\n\nAlcohol: According to DSST, alcohol causes a decrease in performance on their standardized tests, and caffeine causes a significant improvement. When alcohol and caffeine are consumed jointly, the effects of the caffeine are changed, but the alcohol effects remain the same. For example, consuming additional caffeine does not reduce the effect of alcohol. However, the jitteriness and alertness given by caffeine is decreased when additional alcohol is consumed. Alcohol consumption alone reduces both inhibitory and activational aspects of behavioral control. Caffeine antagonizes the effect of alcohol on the activational aspect of behavioral control, but has no effect on the inhibitory behavioral control. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend avoidance of concomitant consumption of alcohol and caffeine, as taking them together may lead to increased alcohol consumption, with a higher risk of alcohol-associated injury.\n\nSmoking: Smoking tobacco has been shown to increase caffeine clearance by 56% as a result of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons inducing the CYP1A2 enzyme. The CYP1A2 enzyme that is induced by smoking is responsible for the metabolism of caffeine; increased enzyme activity leads to increased caffeine clearance, and is associated with greater coffee consumption for regular smokers.\n\nBirth control: Birth control pills can extend the half-life of caffeine by as much as 40%, requiring greater attention to caffeine consumption.\n\nMedications: Caffeine sometimes increases the effectiveness of some medications, such as those for headaches. Caffeine was determined to increase the potency of some over-the-counter analgesic medications by 40%.\nThe pharmacological effects of adenosine may be blunted in individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines like caffeine. Some other examples of methylxanthines include the medications theophylline and aminophylline, which are prescribed to relieve symptoms of asthma or COPD.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: In the absence of caffeine and when a person is awake and alert, little adenosine is present in CNS neurons. With a continued wakeful state, over time adenosine accumulates in the neuronal synapse, in turn binding to and activating adenosine receptors found on certain CNS neurons; when activated, these receptors produce a cellular response that ultimately increases drowsiness. When caffeine is consumed, it antagonizes adenosine receptors; in other words, caffeine prevents adenosine from activating the receptor by blocking the location on the receptor where adenosine binds to it. As a result, caffeine temporarily prevents or relieves drowsiness, and thus maintains or restores alertness.\n\nReceptor and ion channel targets: Caffeine is an antagonist of adenosine A2A receptors, and knockout mouse studies have specifically implicated antagonism of the A2A receptor as responsible for the wakefulness-promoting effects of caffeine. Antagonism of A2A receptors in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) reduces inhibitory GABA neurotransmission to the tuberomammillary nucleus, a histaminergic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal. This disinhibition of the tuberomammillary nucleus is the downstream mechanism by which caffeine produces wakefulness-promoting effects. Caffeine is an antagonist of all four adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3), although with varying potencies. The affinity (KD) values of caffeine for the human adenosine receptors are 12 \u03bcM at A1, 2.4 \u03bcM at A2A, 13 \u03bcM at A2B, and 80 \u03bcM at A3.\nAntagonism of adenosine receptors by caffeine also stimulates the medullary vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers, which increases respiratory rate, reduces heart rate, and constricts blood vessels. Adenosine receptor antagonism also promotes neurotransmitter release (e.g., monoamines and acetylcholine), which endows caffeine with its stimulant effects; adenosine acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that suppresses activity in the central nervous system. Heart palpitations are caused by blockade of the A1 receptor.\nBecause caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble, it readily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier that separates the bloodstream from the interior of the brain. Once in the brain, the principal mode of action is as a nonselective antagonist of adenosine receptors (in other words, an agent that reduces the effects of adenosine). The caffeine molecule is structurally similar to adenosine, and is capable of binding to adenosine receptors on the surface of cells without activating them, thereby acting as a competitive antagonist.\nIn addition to its activity at adenosine receptors, caffeine is an inositol trisphosphate receptor 1 antagonist and a voltage-independent activator of the ryanodine receptors (RYR1, RYR2, and RYR3). It is also a competitive antagonist of the ionotropic glycine receptor.\n\nEffects on striatal dopamine: While caffeine does not directly bind to any dopamine receptors, it influences the binding activity of dopamine at its receptors in the striatum by binding to adenosine receptors that have formed GPCR heteromers with dopamine receptors, specifically the A1\u2013D1 receptor heterodimer (this is a receptor complex with one adenosine A1 receptor and one dopamine D1 receptor) and the A2A\u2013D2 receptor heterotetramer (this is a receptor complex with two adenosine A2A receptors and two dopamine D2 receptors). The A2A\u2013D2 receptor heterotetramer has been identified as a primary pharmacological target of caffeine, primarily because it mediates some of its psychostimulant effects and its pharmacodynamic interactions with dopaminergic psychostimulants.\nCaffeine also causes the release of dopamine in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens core (a substructure within the ventral striatum), but not the nucleus accumbens shell, by antagonizing A1 receptors in the axon terminal of dopamine neurons and A1\u2013A2A heterodimers (a receptor complex composed of one adenosine A1 receptor and one adenosine A2A receptor) in the axon terminal of glutamate neurons. During chronic caffeine use, caffeine-induced dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens core is markedly reduced due to drug tolerance.\n\nEnzyme targets: Caffeine, like other xanthines, also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. As a competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor, caffeine raises intracellular cyclic AMP, activates protein kinase A, inhibits TNF-alpha and leukotriene synthesis, and reduces inflammation and innate immunity. Caffeine also affects the cholinergic system where it is a moderate inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Caffeine from coffee or other beverages is absorbed by the small intestine within 45 minutes of ingestion and distributed throughout all bodily tissues. Peak blood concentration is reached within 1\u20132 hours. It is eliminated by first-order kinetics. Caffeine can also be absorbed rectally, evidenced by suppositories of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine (for the relief of migraine) and of chlorobutanol and caffeine (for the treatment of hyperemesis). However, rectal absorption is less efficient than oral:  the maximum concentration (Cmax) and total amount absorbed (AUC) are both about 30% (i.e., 1/3.5) of the oral amounts.\nCaffeine's biological half-life \u2013 the time required for the body to eliminate one-half of a dose \u2013 varies widely among individuals according to factors such as pregnancy, other drugs, liver enzyme function level (needed for caffeine metabolism) and age. In healthy adults, caffeine's half-life is between 3 and 7 hours. The half-life is decreased by 30-50% in adult male smokers, approximately doubled in women taking oral contraceptives, and prolonged in the last trimester of pregnancy. In newborns the half-life can be 80 hours or more, dropping rapidly with age, possibly to less than the adult value by age 6 months. The antidepressant fluvoxamine (Luvox) reduces the clearance of caffeine by more than 90%, and increases its elimination half-life more than tenfold, from 4.9 hours to 56 hours.\nCaffeine is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme system (particularly by the CYP1A2 isozyme) into three dimethylxanthines, each of which has its own effects on the body:\n\nParaxanthine (84%): Increases lipolysis, leading to elevated glycerol and free fatty acid levels in blood plasma.\nTheobromine (12%): Dilates blood vessels and increases urine volume. Theobromine is also the principal alkaloid in the cocoa bean (chocolate).\nTheophylline (4%): Relaxes smooth muscles of the bronchi, and is used to treat asthma. The therapeutic dose of theophylline, however, is many times greater than the levels attained from caffeine metabolism.\n1,3,7-Trimethyluric acid is a minor caffeine metabolite. 7-Methylxanthine is also a metabolite of caffeine. Each of the above metabolites is further metabolized and then excreted in the urine. Caffeine can accumulate in individuals with severe liver disease, increasing its half-life.\nA 2011 review found that increased caffeine intake was associated with a variation in two genes that increase the rate of caffeine catabolism. Subjects who had this mutation on both chromosomes consumed 40 mg more caffeine per day than others. This is presumably due to the need for a higher intake to achieve a comparable desired effect, not that the gene led to a disposition for greater incentive of habituation.\n\nChemistry: Pure anhydrous caffeine is a bitter-tasting, white, odorless powder with a melting point of 235\u2013238 \u00b0C. Caffeine is moderately soluble in water at room temperature (2 g/100 mL), but quickly soluble in boiling water (66 g/100 mL). It is also moderately soluble in ethanol (1.5 g/100 mL). It is weakly basic (pKa of conjugate acid = ~0.6) requiring strong acid to protonate it. Caffeine does not contain any stereogenic centers and hence is classified as an achiral molecule.\nThe xanthine core of caffeine contains two fused rings, a pyrimidinedione and imidazole.  The pyrimidinedione in turn contains two amide functional groups that exist predominantly in a zwitterionic resonance the location from which the nitrogen atoms are double bonded to their adjacent amide carbons atoms. Hence all six of the atoms within the pyrimidinedione ring system are sp2 hybridized and planar. The imidazole ring also has a resonance. Therefore, the fused 5,6 ring core of caffeine contains a total of ten pi electrons and hence according to H\u00fcckel's rule is aromatic.\n\nSynthesis: The biosynthesis of caffeine is an example of convergent evolution among different species.\nCaffeine may be synthesized in the lab starting with 1,3-dimethylurea and malonic acid. Production of synthesized caffeine largely takes place in pharmaceutical plants in China. Synthetic and natural caffeine are chemically identical and nearly indistinguishable. The primary distinction is that synthetic caffeine is manufactured from urea and chloroacetic acid, while natural caffeine is extracted from plant sources, a process known as decaffeination.\nDespite the different production methods, the final product and its effects on the body are similar. Research on synthetic caffeine supports that it has the same stimulating effects on the body as natural caffeine. And although many claim that natural caffeine is absorbed slower and therefore leads to a gentler caffeine crash, there is little scientific evidence supporting the notion.\n\nDecaffeination: Germany, the birthplace of decaffeinated coffee, is home to several decaffeination plants, including the world's largest, Coffein Compagnie. Over half of the decaf coffee sold in the U.S. first travels from the tropics to Germany for caffeine removal before making its way to American consumers.\nExtraction of caffeine from coffee, to produce caffeine and decaffeinated coffee, can be performed using a number of solvents. Following are main methods:\n\nWater extraction: Coffee beans are soaked in water. The water, which contains many other compounds in addition to caffeine and contributes to the flavor of coffee, is then passed through activated charcoal, which removes the caffeine. The water can then be put back with the beans and evaporated dry, leaving decaffeinated coffee with its original flavor. Coffee manufacturers recover the caffeine and resell it for use in soft drinks and over-the-counter caffeine tablets.\nSupercritical carbon dioxide extraction: Supercritical carbon dioxide is an excellent nonpolar solvent for caffeine, and is safer than the organic solvents that are otherwise used. The extraction process is simple: CO2 is forced through the green coffee beans at temperatures above 31.1 \u00b0C and pressures above 73 atm. Under these conditions, CO2 is in a \"supercritical\" state: It has gaslike properties that allow it to penetrate deep into the beans but also liquid-like properties that dissolve 97\u201399% of the caffeine. The caffeine-laden CO2 is then sprayed with high-pressure water to remove the caffeine. The caffeine can then be isolated by charcoal adsorption (as above) or by distillation, recrystallization, or reverse osmosis.\nExtraction by organic solvents: Certain organic solvents such as ethyl acetate present much less health and environmental hazard than chlorinated and aromatic organic solvents used formerly. Another method is to use triglyceride oils obtained from spent coffee grounds.\n\"Decaffeinated\" coffees do in fact contain caffeine in many cases \u2013 some commercially available decaffeinated coffee products contain considerable levels. One study found that decaffeinated coffee contained 10 mg of caffeine per cup, compared to approximately 85 mg of caffeine per cup for regular coffee.\n\nDetection in body fluids: Caffeine can be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy in neonates, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or facilitate a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma caffeine levels are usually in the range of 2\u201310 mg/L in coffee drinkers, 12\u201336 mg/L in neonates receiving treatment for apnea, and 40\u2013400 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Urinary caffeine concentration is frequently measured in competitive sports programs, for which a level in excess of 15 mg/L is usually considered to represent abuse.\n\nAnalogs: Some analog substances have been created which mimic caffeine's properties with either function or structure or both. Of the latter group are the xanthines DMPX and 8-chlorotheophylline, which is an ingredient in dramamine. Members of a class of nitrogen substituted xanthines are often proposed as potential alternatives to caffeine. Many other xanthine analogues constituting the adenosine receptor antagonist class have also been elucidated.\nSome other caffeine analogs:\n\nDipropylcyclopentylxanthine\n8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine\n8-Phenyltheophylline\n\nPrecipitation of tannins: Caffeine, as do other alkaloids such as cinchonine, quinine or strychnine, precipitates polyphenols and tannins. This property can be used in a quantitation method.\n\nNatural occurrence: Around thirty plant species are known to contain caffeine. Common sources are the \"beans\" (seeds) of the two cultivated coffee plants, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora (the quantity varies, but 1.3% is a typical value); and of the cocoa plant, Theobroma cacao; the leaves of the tea plant; and kola nuts. Other sources include the leaves of yaupon holly, South American holly yerba mate, and Amazonian holly guayusa; and seeds from Amazonian maple guarana berries. Temperate climates around the world have produced unrelated caffeine-containing plants.\nCaffeine in plants acts as a natural pesticide: it can paralyze and kill predator insects feeding on the plant. High caffeine levels are found in coffee seedlings when they are developing foliage and lack mechanical protection. In addition, high caffeine levels are found in the surrounding soil of coffee seedlings, which inhibits seed germination of nearby coffee seedlings, thus giving seedlings with the highest caffeine levels fewer competitors for existing resources for survival.  Caffeine is stored in tea leaves in two places. Firstly, in the cell vacuoles where it is complexed with polyphenols. This caffeine probably is released into the mouth parts of insects, to discourage herbivory. Secondly, around the vascular bundles, where it probably inhibits pathogenic fungi from entering and colonizing the vascular bundles. Caffeine in nectar may improve the reproductive success of the pollen producing plants by enhancing the reward memory of pollinators such as honey bees.\nThe differing perceptions in the effects of ingesting beverages made from various plants containing caffeine could be explained by the fact that these beverages also contain varying mixtures of other methylxanthine alkaloids, including the cardiac stimulants theophylline and theobromine, and polyphenols that can form insoluble complexes with caffeine.\n\nProducts: Products containing caffeine include coffee, tea, soft drinks (\"colas\"), energy drinks, other beverages, chocolate, caffeine tablets, other oral products, and inhalation products. According to a 2020 study in the United States, coffee is the major source of caffeine intake in middle-aged adults, while soft drinks and tea are the major sources in adolescents. Energy drinks are more commonly consumed as a source of caffeine in adolescents as compared to adults.\n\nBeverages: \n\nCoffee: The world's primary source of caffeine is the coffee \"bean\" (the seed of the coffee plant), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of coffee bean and the method of preparation used; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety espresso, to approximately 100\u2013125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee. Arabica coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the robusta variety.\nIn general, dark-roast coffee has slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount.\n\nTea: Tea contains more caffeine than coffee by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since less of the product is used as compared to an equivalent serving of coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine.\nTea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese green tea, gyokuro, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like lapsang souchong, which has minimal content.\n\nSoft drinks and energy drinks: Caffeine is also a common ingredient of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce (350 mL) serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.\n\nOther beverages: Mat\u00e9 is a drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly yerba mate, pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves.\nGuaran\u00e1 is a soft drink originating in Brazil made from the seeds of the Guaran\u00e1 fruit.\nThe leaves of Ilex guayusa, the Ecuadorian holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a guayusa tea.\nThe leaves of Ilex vomitoria, the yaupon holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a yaupon tea.\nCommercially prepared coffee-flavoured milk beverages are popular in Australia. Examples include Oak's Ice Coffee and Farmers Union Iced Coffee. The amount of caffeine in these beverages can vary widely. Caffeine concentrations can differ significantly from the manufacturer's claims.\n\nCacao solids: Cocoa solids (derived from cocoa bean) contain 230 mg caffeine per 100 g.\nThe caffeine content varies between cocoa bean strains. Caffeine content mg/g (sorted by lowest caffeine content):\n\nForastero (defatted): 1.3 mg/g\nNacional (defatted): 2.4 mg/g\nTrinitario (defatted): 6.3/g\nCriollo (defatted): 11.3 mg/g\n\nChocolate: Caffeine per 100 g:\n\nDark chocolate, 70-85% cacao solids: 80 mg\nDark chocolate, 60-69% cacao solids: 86 mg\nDark chocolate, 45- 59% cacao solids: 43 mg\nMilk chocolate: 20 mg\nThe stimulant effect of chocolate may be due to a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine.\n\nTablets: Tablets offer several advantages over coffee, tea, and other caffeinated beverages, including convenience, known dosage, and avoidance of concomitant intake of sugar, acids, and fluids. A use of caffeine in this form is said to improve mental alertness. These tablets are commonly used by students studying for their exams and by people who work or drive for long hours.\n\nOther oral products: One U.S. company is marketing oral dissolvable caffeine strips. Another intake route is SpazzStick, a caffeinated lip balm. Alert Energy Caffeine Gum was introduced in the United States in 2013, but was voluntarily withdrawn after an announcement of an investigation by the FDA of the health effects of added caffeine in foods.\n\nInhalants: Similar to an e-cigarette, a caffeine inhaler may be used to deliver caffeine or a stimulant like guarana by vaping. In 2012, the FDA sent a warning letter to one of the companies marketing an inhaler, expressing concerns for the lack of safety information available about inhaled caffeine.\n\nCombinations with other drugs: Some beverages combine alcohol with caffeine to create a caffeinated alcoholic drink.  The stimulant effects of caffeine may mask the depressant effects of alcohol, potentially reducing the user's awareness of their level of intoxication.  Such beverages have been the subject of bans due to safety concerns.  In particular, the United States Food and Drug Administration has classified caffeine added to malt liquor beverages as an \"unsafe food additive\".\nYa ba contains a combination of methamphetamine and caffeine.\nPainkillers such as propyphenazone/paracetamol/caffeine combine caffeine with an analgesic.\n\nHistory: \n\nDiscovery and spread of use: According to Chinese legend, the Chinese emperor Shennong, reputed to have reigned in about 3000 BCE, inadvertently discovered tea when he noted that when certain leaves fell into boiling water, a fragrant and restorative drink resulted. Shennong is also mentioned in Lu Yu's Cha Jing, a famous early work on the subject of tea.\nThe earliest credible evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee plant appears in the middle of the fifteenth century, in the Sufi monasteries of the Yemen in southern Arabia. From Mocha, coffee spread to Egypt and North Africa, and by the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, Persia and Turkey.  From the Middle East, coffee drinking spread to Italy, then to the rest of Europe, and coffee plants were transported by the Dutch to the East Indies and to the Americas.\nKola nut use appears to have ancient origins. It is chewed in many West African cultures, in both private and social settings, to restore vitality and ease hunger pangs.\nThe earliest evidence of cocoa bean use comes from residue found in an ancient Mayan pot dated to 600 BCE. Also, chocolate was consumed in a bitter and spicy drink called xocolatl, often seasoned with vanilla, chile pepper, and achiote. Xocolatl was believed to fight fatigue, a belief probably attributable to the theobromine and caffeine content. Chocolate was an important luxury good throughout pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, and cocoa beans were often used as currency.\nXocolatl was introduced to Europe by the Spaniards, and became a popular beverage by 1700. The Spaniards also introduced the cacao tree into the West Indies and the Philippines.\nThe leaves and stems of the yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria) were used by Native Americans to brew a tea called asi or the \"black drink\". Archaeologists have found evidence of this use far into antiquity, possibly dating to Late Archaic times.\n\nChemical identification, isolation, and synthesis: In 1819, the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge isolated relatively pure caffeine for the first time; he called it \"Kaffebase\" (i.e., a base that exists in coffee). According to Runge, he did this at the behest of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In 1821, caffeine was isolated both by the French chemist Pierre Jean Robiquet and by another pair of French chemists, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph Bienaim\u00e9 Caventou, according to Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius in his yearly journal. Furthermore, Berzelius stated that the French chemists had made their discoveries independently of any knowledge of Runge's or each other's work. However, Berzelius later acknowledged Runge's priority in the extraction of caffeine, stating: \"However, at this point, it should not remain unmentioned that Runge (in his Phytochemical Discoveries, 1820, pages 146\u2013147) specified the same method and described caffeine under the name Caffeebase a year earlier than Robiquet, to whom the discovery of this substance is usually attributed, having made the first oral announcement about it at a meeting of the Pharmacy Society in Paris.\"\nPelletier's article on caffeine was the first to use the term in print (in the French form Caf\u00e9ine from the French word for coffee: caf\u00e9). It corroborates Berzelius's account:\n\nCaffeine, noun (feminine). Crystallizable substance discovered in coffee in 1821 by Mr. Robiquet. During the same period \u2013 while they were searching for quinine in coffee because coffee is considered by several doctors to be a medicine that reduces fevers and because coffee belongs to the same family as the cinchona [quinine] tree \u2013 on their part, Messrs. Pelletier and Caventou obtained caffeine; but because their research had a different goal and because their research had not been finished, they left priority on this subject to Mr. Robiquet. We do not know why Mr. Robiquet has not published the analysis of coffee which he read to the Pharmacy Society. Its publication would have allowed us to make caffeine better known and give us accurate ideas of coffee's composition ...\nRobiquet was one of the first to isolate and describe the properties of pure caffeine, whereas Pelletier was the first to perform an elemental analysis.\nIn 1827, M. Oudry isolated \"th\u00e9ine\" from tea, but in 1838 it was proved by Mulder and by Carl Jobst that theine was actually the same as caffeine.\nIn 1895, German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer (1852\u20131919) first synthesized caffeine from its chemical components (i.e. a \"total synthesis\"), and two years later, he also derived the structural formula of the compound. This was part of the work for which Fischer was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902.\n\nHistoric regulations: Because it was recognized that coffee contained some compound that acted as a stimulant, first coffee and later also caffeine has sometimes been subject to regulation. For example, in the 16th century Islamists in Mecca and in the Ottoman Empire made coffee illegal for some classes. Charles II of England tried to ban it in 1676, Frederick II of Prussia banned it in 1777, and coffee was banned in Sweden at various times between 1756 and 1823.\nIn 1911, caffeine became the focus of one of the earliest documented health scares, when the US government seized 40 barrels and 20 kegs of Coca-Cola syrup in Chattanooga, Tennessee, alleging the caffeine in its drink was \"injurious to health\". Although the Supreme Court later ruled in favor of Coca-Cola in United States v. Forty Barrels and Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola, two bills were introduced to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1912 to amend the Pure Food and Drug Act, adding caffeine to the list of \"habit-forming\" and \"deleterious\" substances, which must be listed on a product's label.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nRegulations: \n\nUnited States: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers safe beverages containing less than 0.02% caffeine; but caffeine powder, which is sold as a dietary supplement, is unregulated. It is a regulatory requirement that the label of most prepackaged foods must declare a list of ingredients, including food additives such as caffeine, in descending order of proportion. However, there is no regulatory provision for mandatory quantitative labeling of caffeine, (e.g., milligrams caffeine per stated serving size). There are a number of food ingredients that naturally contain caffeine. These ingredients must appear in food ingredient lists. However, as is the case for \"food additive caffeine\", there is no requirement to identify the quantitative amount of caffeine in composite foods containing ingredients that are natural sources of caffeine. While coffee or chocolate are broadly recognized as caffeine sources, some ingredients (e.g., guarana, yerba mat\u00e9) are likely less recognized as caffeine sources. For these natural sources of caffeine, there is no regulatory provision requiring that a food label identify the presence of caffeine nor state the amount of caffeine present in the food. The FDA guidance was updated in 2018.\n\nConsumption: Global consumption of caffeine has been estimated at 120,000 tonnes per year, making it the world's most popular psychoactive substance. The consumption of caffeine has remained stable between 1997 and 2015. Coffee, tea and soft drinks are the most common caffeine sources, with energy drinks contributing little to the total caffeine intake across all age groups.\n\nReligions: The Seventh-day Adventist Church asked for its members to \"abstain from caffeinated drinks\", but has removed this from baptismal vows (while still recommending abstention as policy). Some from these religions believe that one is not supposed to consume a non-medical, psychoactive substance, or believe that one is not supposed to consume a substance that is addictive. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has said the following with regard to caffeinated beverages: \"... the Church revelation spelling out health practices (Doctrine and Covenants 89) does not mention the use of caffeine.  The Church's health guidelines prohibit alcoholic drinks, smoking or chewing of tobacco, and 'hot drinks' \u2013 taught by Church leaders to refer specifically to tea and coffee.\"\nGaudiya Vaishnavas generally also abstain from caffeine, because they believe it clouds the mind and overstimulates the senses. To be initiated under a guru, one must have had no caffeine, alcohol, nicotine or other drugs, for at least a year.\nCaffeinated beverages are widely consumed by Muslims. In the 16th century, some Muslim authorities made unsuccessful attempts to ban them as forbidden \"intoxicating beverages\" under Islamic dietary laws.\n\nOther organisms: The bacteria Pseudomonas putida CBB5 can live on pure caffeine and can cleave caffeine into carbon dioxide and ammonia.\nCaffeine is toxic to birds and to dogs and cats, and has a pronounced adverse effect on mollusks, various insects, and spiders. This is at least partly due to a poor ability to metabolize the compound, causing higher levels for a given dose per unit weight. Caffeine has also been found to enhance the reward memory of honey bees.\n\nResearch: Caffeine has been used to double chromosomes in haploid wheat.\n\nSee also: Adderall\nAmphetamine\nCocaine\nHealth effects of coffee\nHealth effects of tea\nList of chemical compounds in coffee\nLow caffeine coffee\nMethylliberine\nNootropic\nTheobromine\nTheophylline\nWakefulness-promoting agent\n\nReferences: Notes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography: \n\nExternal links: \nGMD MS Spectrum\nCaffeine: ChemSub Online\nCaffeine at The Periodic Table of Videos (University of Nottingham)\n\n\n pubchem:\nCaffeine appears as odorless white powder or white glistening needles, usually melted together. Bitter taste. Solutions in water are neutral to litmus. Odorless. (NTP, 1992)\nCaffeine is a trimethylxanthine in which the three methyl groups are located at positions 1, 3, and 7. A purine alkaloid that occurs naturally in tea and coffee. It has a role as a central nervous system stimulant, an EC 3.1.4.* (phosphoric diester hydrolase) inhibitor, an adenosine receptor antagonist, an EC 2.7.11.1 (non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor, a ryanodine receptor agonist, a fungal metabolite, an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, a psychotropic drug, a diuretic, a food additive, an adjuvant, a plant metabolite, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic, a human blood serum metabolite, a mouse metabolite, a geroprotector and a mutagen. It is a purine alkaloid and a trimethylxanthine.\nCaffeine is a drug of the methylxanthine class used for a variety of purposes, including certain respiratory conditions of the premature newborn, pain relief, and to combat drowsiness. Caffeine is similar in chemical structure to [Theophylline] and [Theobromine]. It can be sourced from coffee beans, but also occurs naturally in various teas and cacao beans, which are different than coffee beans. Caffeine is also used in a variety of cosmetic products and can be administered topically, orally, by inhalation, or by injection.  The caffeine citrate injection, used for apnea of the premature newborn, was initially approved by the FDA in 1999. According to an article from 2017, more than 15 million babies are born prematurely worldwide. This correlates to about 1 in 10 births. Premature birth can lead to apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a condition that interferes with lung development and may eventually cause asthma or early onset emphysema in those born prematurely. Caffeine is beneficial in preventing and treating apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns, improving the quality of life of premature infants.\nCaffeine is a Central Nervous System Stimulant and Methylxanthine. The physiologic effect of caffeine is by means of Central Nervous System Stimulation.\nCaffeine is xanthine alkaloid that occurs naturally in seeds, leaves and fruit of several plants and trees that acts as a natural pesticide. Caffeine is a major component of coffee, tea and chocolate and in humans acts as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. Consumption of caffeine, even in high doses, has not been associated with elevations in serum enzyme elevations or instances of clinically apparent liver injury.\nCaffeine has been reported in Camellia sinensis, Claviceps sorghicola, and other organisms with data available.\nCaffeine is a methylxanthine alkaloid found in the seeds, nuts, or leaves of a number of plants native to South America and East Asia that is structurally related to adenosine and acts primarily as an adenosine receptor antagonist with psychotropic and anti-inflammatory activities. Upon ingestion, caffeine binds to adenosine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), which inhibits adenosine binding. This inhibits the adenosine-mediated downregulation of CNS activity; thus, stimulating the activity of the medullary, vagal, vasomotor, and respiratory centers in the brain. This agent also promotes neurotransmitter release that further stimulates the CNS. The anti-inflammatory effects of caffeine are due the nonselective competitive inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Inhibition of PDEs raises the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP (cAMP), activates protein kinase A, and inhibits leukotriene synthesis, which leads to reduced inflammation and innate immunity.\nCAFFEINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1948 and has 4 approved and 59 investigational indications.\nCaffeine is the most widely consumed psychostimulant drug in the world that mostly is consumed in the form of coffee. Whether caffeine and/or coffee consumption contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the single leading cause of death in the US, is unclear. The literature indicates a strong relationship between boiled, unfiltered coffee consumption and elevated cholesterol levels; however, there is a critical gap in the literature regarding the effects of coffee or caffeine consumption on fibrinogen or CRP, which is an independent predictor of CVD risk. Available studies are limited by small samples sizes, inclusion of only men (or few women) and unrepresented age or ethnic groups. There is a critical need for controlled laboratory and epidemiological studies that include fibrinogen and CRP markers of CVD risk before conclusions can be drawn regarding the health effects of caffeine and/or coffee in a normal, healthy population of men and women. (A11723). The relationship between caffeine consumption and various illnesses such as cardiovascular disease and cancer remains equivocal. Prudence might dictate that pregnant women and chronically ill individuals exercise restraint in their use of caffeine, although research suggests relatively low or nonexistent levels of risk associated with moderate caffeine consumption. (A7827). There is extensive evidence that caffeine at dietary doses increases blood pressure (BP). However, concern that the drug may contribute to cardiovascular disease appears to have been dampened by (1) the belief that habitual use leads to the development of tolerance, and (2) confusion regarding relevant epidemiologic findings. When considered comprehensively, findings from experimental and epidemiologic studies converge to show that BP remains reactive to the pressor effects of caffeine in the diet. Overall, the impact of dietary caffeine on population BP levels is likely to be modest, probably in the region of 4/2 mm Hg. At these levels, however, population studies of BP indicate that caffeine use could account for premature deaths in the region of 14% for coronary heart disease and 20% for stroke. (A7828). Caffeine is a purine alkaloid that occurs naturally in coffee beans. At intake levels associated with coffee consumption, caffeine appears to exert most of its biological effects through the antagonism of the A1 and A2A subtypes of the adenosine receptor. Adenosine is an endogenous neuromodulator with mostly inhibitory effects, and adenosine antagonism by caffeine results in effects that are generally stimulatory. Some physiological effects associated with caffeine administration include central nervous system stimulation, acute elevation of blood pressure, increased metabolic rate, and diuresis. Caffeine concentrations in coffee beverages can be quite variable. A standard cup of coffee is often assumed to provide 100 mg of caffeine, but a recent analysis of 14 different specialty coffees purchased at coffee shops in the US found that the amount of caffeine in 8 oz (=240 ml) of brewed coffee ranged from 72 to 130 mg.Caffeine in espresso coffees ranged from 58 to 76 mg in a single shot. (A7829). Caffeine is a member of the methylxanthine family of drugs, and is the most widely consumed behaviourally active substance in the western world. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that caffeine modulates both innate and adaptive immune responses. For instance studies indicate that caffeine and its major metabolite paraxanthine suppress neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis, and also suppress production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from human blood. Caffeine has also been reported to suppress human lymphocyte function as indicated by reduced T-cell proliferation and impaired production of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2 and interferon [IFN]-gamma), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) and Th3 (IL-10) cytokines. Studies also indicate that caffeine suppresses antibody production. The evidence suggests that at least some of the immunomodulatory actions of caffeine are mediated via inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-phosphodiesterase (PDE), and consequential increase in intracellular cAMP concentrations. Overall, these studies indicate that caffeine, like other members of the methylxanthine family, is largely anti-inflammatory in nature, and based on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine, many of its immunomodulatory effects occur at concentrations that are relevant to normal human consumption. (A7830).\nA methylxanthine naturally occurring in some beverages and also used as a pharmacological agent. Caffeine's most notable pharmacological effect is as a central nervous system stimulant, increasing alertness and producing agitation. It also relaxes SMOOTH MUSCLE, stimulates CARDIAC MUSCLE, stimulates DIURESIS, and appears to be useful in the treatment of some types of headache. Several cellular actions of caffeine have been observed, but it is not entirely clear how each contributes to its pharmacological profile. Among the most important are inhibition of cyclic nucleotide PHOSPHODIESTERASES, antagonism of ADENOSINE RECEPTORS, and modulation of intracellular calcium handling.\nSee also: Caffeine Citrate (has salt form); Aspirin; caffeine; orphenadrine citrate (component of); Acetaminophen; Butalbital; Caffeine (component of) ...

        "text1": "Title: Gemfibrozil\nwikipedia: Gemfibrozil, sold under the brand name Lopid among others, is a medication used to treat abnormal blood lipid levels. It is generally less preferred than statins. Use is recommended together with dietary changes and exercise. It is unclear if it changes the risk of heart disease. It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include headache, dizziness, feeling tired, and intestinal upset. Serious side effects may include angioedema, gallstones, liver problems, and muscle breakdown. Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It belongs to the fibrates group of medications and works by decreasing the breakdown of lipids in fat cells.\nGemfibrozil was patented in 1968, and came into medical use in 1982. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 231st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Hyperlipidemia (Type III)\nHypertriglyceridemia (Type IV): Gemfibrozil, though not as effective as niacin (nicotinic acid, a form of Vitamin B3), is better tolerated.\nReduce triglyceride levels \nReduce very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels\nModest reduction of low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels\nModerate increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels\n\nSide effects: GI distress\nMusculoskeletal pain\nIncreased incidence of gallstone\nHypokalemia (low blood potassium)\nIncreased risk of cancer\n\nContraindications: Gemfibrozil should not be given to these patients:\nHepatic dysfunction\nGemfibrozil should be used with caution in these higher risk categories:\nBiliary tract disease\nRenal dysfunction\nPregnant women\nObese patients\n\nDrug interactions: Anticoagulants: Gemfibrozil potentiates the action of warfarin and indanedione anticoagulants.\nStatin drugs: Concomitant administration of fibrates (including gemfibrozil) with statin drugs increases the risk of muscle cramping, myopathy, and rhabdomyolysis.\nGemfibrozil inhibits the activation of the liver's Cytochrome P450 system and CYP2C8, reducing hepatic metabolism of many drugs, and prolonging their half lives and duration of action.\nDrugs metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system include:\nMany antidepressants\nMany antipsychotics\nMany antiepileptics\nTheophylline and other methylxanthine drugs\nSeveral anesthetic agents\nOral contraceptive pills\nStatins\nWarfarin\nSelexipag\n\nMechanism of actions: The exact mechanism of action of gemfibrozil is unknown; however, several theories exist regarding the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) effect; it can inhibit lipolysis and decrease subsequent hepatic fatty acid uptake as well as inhibit hepatic secretion of VLDL; together these actions decrease serum VLDL levels and increase HDL-cholesterol; the mechanism behind HDL elevation is currently unknown.\nGemfibrozil increases the activity of extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase (LL), thereby increasing lipoprotein triglyceride lipolysis. It does so by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1) 'transcription factor ligand', a receptor that is involved in metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, as well as adipose tissue differentiation. This increase in the synthesis of lipoprotein lipase thereby increases the clearance of triglycerides. Chylomicrons are degraded, VLDLs are converted to LDLs, and LDLs are converted to HDL. This is accompanied by a slight increase in secretion of lipids into the bile and ultimately the intestine. Gemfibrozil also inhibits the synthesis and increases the clearance of apolipoprotein B, a carrier molecule for VLDL.\n\nHistory: Gemfibrozil was selected from a series of related compounds synthesized in the laboratories of the American company Parke-Davis in the late 1970s. It came from research for compounds that lower plasma lipid levels in humans and in animals.\n\nEnvironmental data: Gemfibrozil has been detected in biosolids (the solids remaining after sewage treatment) at concentrations up to 2650 ng/g wet weight. This indicates that it survives the wastewater treatment process. It is also detected as environmental persistent micropollutant in aquifers and in groundwaters in karstic areas.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: \n\nExternal links: \"Lopid International Study\" (PDF).

It has a role as an antilipemic drug. It is functionally related to a valeric acid.\nGemfibrozil is a fibric acid agent, similar to [clofibrate], used to treat Type IIb, IV, and V hyperlipidemias. Gemfibrozil is not a first line treatment and is prescribed to patients who have not responded adequately to weight loss, diet, exercise, and other medications.  Gemfibrozil was granted FDA approval on 21 December 1981.\nGemfibrozil is a Peroxisome Proliferator Receptor alpha Agonist. The mechanism of action of gemfibrozil is as a Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor alpha Agonist.\nGemfibrozil is a fibric acid derivative used in the therapy of hypertriglyceridemia and dyslipidemia. Gemfibrozil therapy is associated with mild and transient serum aminotransferase elevations and with rare instances of acute liver injury.\nGemfibrozil is a fibric acid derivative with hypolipidemic effects. Gemfibrozil interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARalpha) resulting in PPARalpha-mediated stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and an increase in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) synthesis. This enhances triglyceride-rich lipoprotein clearance and reduces the expression of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III). The reduction in hepatic production of apoC-III results in subsequent reduction of serum levels of very-low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). In addition, gemfibrozil-mediated PPARalpha stimulation of apoA-I and apoA-II expression results in an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C).\nGEMFIBROZIL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1981 and has 3 approved and 10 investigational indications.\nA lipid-regulating agent that lowers elevated serum lipids primarily by decreasing serum triglycerides with a variable reduction in total cholesterol. These decreases occur primarily in the VLDL fraction and less frequently in the LDL fraction. Gemfibrozil increases HDL subfractions HDL2 and HDL3 as well as apolipoproteins A-I and A-II.

        "text2": "Title: Fenofibrate\nwikipedia: Fenofibrate (sold under the brand name Tricor among others), is an oral medication of the fibrate class used to treat abnormal blood lipid levels. It is less commonly used compared than statins because it treats a different type of cholesterol abnormality to statins. While statins have strong evidence for reducing heart disease and death, there is evidence to suggest that fenofibrate also reduces the risk of heart disease and death. However, this seems only to apply to specific populations of people with elevated triglyceride levels and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Its use is recommended together with dietary changes.\nCommon side effects include liver problems, breathing problems, abdominal pain, muscle problems, and nausea. Serious side effects may include toxic epidermal necrolysis, rhabdomyolysis, gallstones, and pancreatitis. Use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by  multiple mechanisms.\nIt was patented in 1969, and came into medical use in 1975. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 88th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Fenofibrate is mainly used for primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Fenofibrate may slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy and the need for invasive treatment such as laser therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with pre-existing retinopathy. It was initially indicated for diabetic retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in Australia. The large scale, international FIELD and ACCORD-Eye trials found that fenofibrate therapy reduced required laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy by 1.5% over 5 years, as well as reducing progression by 3.7% over 4 years.  Further studies looking at the role of fenofibrate in the progression of diabetic retinopathy as the primary outcome is warranted to understand its role in this condition. Although no statistically significant cardiovascular risk benefits were identified in these trials, benefits may accrue to add on therapy to patients with high triglyceride dyslipidaemia currently taking statin medications.\nFenofibrate appears to reduce the risk of below ankle amputations in patients with Type 2 diabetes without microvascular disease. The FIELD study reported that fenofibrate at doses of 200 mg daily, reduced the risk for any amputation by 37% independent of glycaemic control, presence or absence of dyslipidaemia and its lipid-lowering mechanism of action. However, the cohort of participants who underwent amputations were more likely to have had previous cardiovascular disease (e.g. angina, myocardial infarction), longer duration of diabetes and had baseline neuropathy.\nFenofibrate has an off-label use as an added therapy of high blood uric acid levels in people who have gout.\nIt is used in addition to diet to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and apolipoprotein B (apo B), and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) in adults with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.\n\nSevere hypertriglyceridemia type IV or V: It is used in tandem with diet for treatment of adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Improving glycemic control in diabetics showing fasting chylomicronemia usually reduces the need for pharmacologic intervention.\nStatins remain the first line for treatment of blood cholesterol. AHA guidelines from 2013 did not find evidence for routine use of additional medications.\nAdditionally, in 2016, the FDA filed \"Withdrawal of Approval of Indications Related to the Coadministration With Statins in Applications for Niacin Extended-Release Tablets and Fenofibric Acid Delayed Release Capsules\" noting \"the Agency has concluded that the totality of the scientific evidence no longer supports the conclusion that a drug-induced reduction in triglyceride levels and/or increase in HDL cholesterol levels in statin-treated patients results in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events. Consistent with this conclusion, FDA has determined that the benefits of niacin ER tablets and fenofibric acid DR capsules for coadministration with statins no longer outweigh the risks, and the approvals for this indication should be withdrawn.\"\n\nContraindications: Fenofibrate is contraindicated in:\n\nPatients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis (2.7-fold increase in exposure, and increased accumulation during chronic dosing in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min)\nPatients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function test abnormalities\nPatients with preexisting gallbladder disease\nNursing mothers\nHypothyroidism\nPatients with known hypersensitivity to fenofibrate or fenofibric acid\n\nAdverse effects: The most common adverse events (>3% of patients with coadministered statins) are\n\nPrecautions: When fenofibrate and a statin are given as combination therapy, it is recommended that fenofibrate be given in the morning and the statin at night, so that the peak dosages do not overlap.\nMusculoskeletal\n\nMyopathy and rhabdomyolysis; increased risk when coadminstered with a statin, particularly in the elderly and patients with diabetes, kidney failure, hypothyroidism\nHepatotoxicity\n\nCan increase serum transaminases; liver tests should be monitored periodically\nNephrotoxicity\n\nCan increase serum creatinine levels; renal function should be monitored periodically in patients with chronic kidney disease\nBiliary\n\nCan increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to risk of cholelithiasis; if suspected, gallbladder studies are indicated. See \"Interaction\" section under Bile acid sequestrant\nCoagulation/Bleeding\n\nExercise caution in concomitant treatment with oral Coumadin anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin). Adjust the dosage of Coumadin to maintain the prothrombin time/INR at desired level to prevent bleeding complications.\n\nOverdose: \"There is no specific treatment for overdose with fenofibric acid delayed-release capsules. General supportive care is indicated, including monitoring of vital signs and observation of clinical status\". Additionally, hemodialysis should not be considered as an overdose treatment option because fenofibrate heavily binds to plasma proteins and does not dialyze well.\n\nInteractions: These drug interactions with fenofibrate are considered major and may need therapy modifications:\n\nBile acid sequestrants (e.g. cholestyramine, colestipol, etc.): If taken together, bile acid resins may bind to fenofibrate, resulting in a decrease in fenofibrate absorption. To maximize absorption, patients need to separate administration by at least 1 h before or 4 h to 6 h after taking the bile acid sequestrant.\nImmunosuppressants (e.g. ciclosporin or tacrolimus): An increased risk of renal dysfunction exists with concomitant use of immunosuppressants and fenofibrate. Approach with caution when coadministering additional medications that decrease renal function.\nVitamin K antagonists (e.g. warfarin): As previously mentioned, fenofibrate interacts with coumadin anticoagulants to increase the risk of bleeding. Dosage adjustment of vitamin K antagonist may be necessary.\nStatins: Combination of statins and fenofibrate may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis or myopathy.\n\nMechanism of action: \"In summary, enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles and reduced secretion of VLDL underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effect of fibrates, whereas their effect on HDL metabolism is associated with changes in HDL apolipoprotein expression.\"\nFenofibrate is a fibrate derivative, a prodrug comprising fenofibric acid linked to an isopropyl ester. It lowers lipid levels by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR\u03b1). PPAR\u03b1 activates lipoprotein lipase and reduces apoprotein CIII, which increases lipolysis and elimination of triglyceride-rich particles from plasma.\nPPAR\u03b1 also increases apoproteins AI and AII, reduces VLDL- and LDL-containing apoprotein B, and increases HDL-containing apoprotein AI and AII.\n\nFormulations: Fenofibrate is available in several formulations and is sold under several brand names, including:\n\nTricor by AbbVie\nLipofen by Kowa Pharmaceuticals America Inc\nLofibra by Teva\nLipanthyl, Lipidil, Lipantil micro and Supralip by Abbott Laboratories\nFenocor-67 by Ordain Health Care\nFenogal by SMB Laboratories\nAntara by Oscient Pharmaceuticals\nTricheck by Zydus (CND)\nAtorva TG by Zydus Medica\nGolip by GolgiUSA\nStanlip by Sun Pharma (India)\nThe formulations may differ in terms of pharmacokinetic properties, particularly bioavailability; some must be taken with meals, whereas others may be taken without regard to food.\nThe choline salt of fenofibrate is available in the United States, sold as Trilipix, and may be taken without regard to meals.\n\nEnvironmental presence: Fenofibric acid was one of the 12 compounds identified in sludge samples taken from 12 wastewater treatment plants in California that were associated with estrogenic activity in in vitro.\n\nHistory: Fenofibrate was first synthesized in 1974, as a derivative of clofibrate, and was initially offered in France. It was initially known as procetofen, and was later renamed fenofibrate to comply with World Health Organization International Nonproprietary Name guidelines.\nFenofibrate was developed by Groupe Fournier SA of France.\n\nSociety and culture: In the United States, Tricor was reformulated in 2005. This reformulation was controversial, seen as an attempt to stifle competition from generic equivalents, and was the subject of antitrust litigation by Teva.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nFenofibrate is a chlorobenzophenone that is (4-chlorophenyl)(phenyl)methanone substituted by a [2-methyl-1-oxo-1-(propan-2-yloxy)propan-2-yl]oxy group at position 1 on the phenyl ring.

Fenofibrate is hydrolyzed in vivo to its active metabolite fenofibric acid that binds to and activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), resulting in the activation of lipoprotein lipase and reduction of the production of apoprotein C-III, an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase activity. Increased lipolysis and a fall in plasma triglycerides, in turn, leads to the modification of the small, dense low density lipoporotein (LDL) particles into larger particles that are catabolized more rapidly due to a greater affinity for cholesterol receptors. In addition, activation of PPARalpha also increases the synthesis of apoproteins A-I, A-II, and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Overall, fenofibrate reduces total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, total triglycerides and triglyceride rich lipoprotein (VLDL) while increasing HDL cholesterol.\nFENOFIBRATE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1993 and has 6 approved and 24 investigational indications.\nAn antilipemic agent which reduces both cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. \nAn antilipemic agent which reduces both CHOLESTEROL and TRIGLYCERIDES in the blood.\nSee also: Fenofibric Acid (has active moiety).\nsafety: Health Hazard\nsmiles: CC(C)OC(=O)C(C)(C)OC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(=O)C2=CC=C(C=C2)Cl\nforumla: C20H21ClO4\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 360.8 g/mol\nXLogP3: 5.2\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 0\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 4\nRotatable Bond Count: 7\nExact Mass: 360.1128368 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 360.1128368 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 52.6\nHeavy Atom Count: 25\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 458\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text1": "Title: Psilocin\nwikipedia: Psilocin, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (4-OH-DMT), is a substituted tryptamine alkaloid and a serotonergic psychedelic. It is present in most psychedelic mushrooms together with its phosphorylated counterpart psilocybin. Psilocin is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Acting on the serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, psilocin's psychedelic effects are directly correlated with the drug's occupancy at these receptor sites. The subjective mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and are said to resemble those of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT).\n\nEffects: Its physiological effects are similar to a sympathetic arousal state. Specific effects observed after ingestion can include but are not limited to tachycardia, dilated pupils, restlessness or arousal, euphoria, open and closed eye visuals (common at medium to high doses), synesthesia  (e.g. hearing colours and seeing sounds), increased body temperature, headache, sweating and chills, and nausea. Psilocin acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptor agonist or partial agonist. Such receptors are claimed to significantly regulate visual processing, decision making, mood, blood pressure, and heart rate.\nThere has been no direct lethality associated with psilocin. There has been no reported withdrawal syndrome when chronic use of this drug is ceased.  There is cross tolerance among psilocin, mescaline, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and other 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT1A receptor agonists due to downregulation of these receptors.\n\nPharmacology: Psilocin is the pharmacologically active agent in the body after ingestion of psilocybin or some species of psychedelic mushrooms.\nPsilocybin is rapidly dephosphorylated in the body to psilocin which acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptor agonist or partial agonist. Psilocin exhibits  functional selectivity in that it activates phospholipase A2 instead of activating phospholipase C as the endogenous ligand serotonin does. Psilocin is structurally similar to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), differing only by the hydroxyl group being on the 4-position rather than the 5 and the dimethyl groups on the nitrogen. Its effects are thought to come from its agonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex.\nPsilocin has no significant effect on dopamine receptors (unlike lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)) and only affects the noradrenergic system at very high doses.\nPsilocin's elimination half-life ranges from 1 to 3 hours depending on route of administration of psilocybin.\n\nChemistry: Psilocin and its phosphorylated cousin, psilocybin, were first isolated and named in 1958 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann. Hofmann obtained the chemicals from laboratory-grown specimens of the entheogenic mushroom Psilocybe mexicana. Hofmann also succeeded in finding synthetic routes to these chemicals.\nPsilocin can be obtained by dephosphorylation of natural psilocybin under strongly acidic or under alkaline conditions (hydrolysis). A synthetic route uses the Speeter\u2013Anthony tryptamine synthesis procedure. First, 4-hydroxyindole is Friedel-Crafts-acylated with oxalyl chloride in position 3. The compound is further reacted with dimethylamine, yielding the indole-3-yl-glyoxamide. Finally, this 4-hydroxyindole-3-N,N-dimethylglyoxamide is reduced by lithium aluminum hydride yielding psilocin. \nPsilocin is relatively unstable in solution due to its phenolic hydroxy (-OH) group. In the presence of oxygen, it readily forms bluish and dark black degradation products. Similar products are also formed in the presence of oxygen and Fe3+ ions.\n\nAnalogues: Sulfur analogs are known with a benzothienyl replacement as well as 4-SH-DMT. 1-Methylpsilocin is a functionally 5-HT2C receptor preferring agonist. 4-Fluoro-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is known.  O-Acetylpsilocin (4-AcO-DMT) is the ester of acetic acid with  psilocin. Additionally, replacement of a methyl group at the dimethylated nitrogen with an isopropyl or ethyl group yields 4-HO-MIPT (4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine) and 4-HO-MET (4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine), respectively. 4-Acetoxy-MET (4-Acetoxy-N-methyl-N-ethyltryptamine), also known as 4-AcO-MET, is the acetate ester of 4-HO-MET, and a homologue of 4-AcO-DMT.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nLegal status: The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances (adopted in 1971) requires its members to prohibit psilocybin, and parties to the treaty are required to restrict the use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions.\n\nAustralia: Psilocin is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.\n\nRussia: Psilocin and psilocybin are banned in Russia, due to their status as narcotic drugs, with a criminal penalty for possession of more than 50 mg.\n\nResearch: Psilocin is being evaluated under the developmental code name PLZ-1015 for the treatment of pervasive developmental disorders like autism in children.\n\nSee also: Metocin\nMiprocin\nO-4310\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: 4-HO-DMT entry in TiHKAL\n\n\n pubchem:\nPsilocin is a tryptamine alkaloid that is N,N-dimethyltryptamine carrying an additional hydroxy substituent at position 4.

The mind-altering effects of psilocin are highly variable and subjective, but resemble those caused by LSD and mescaline. The effects typically last anywhere from three to eight hours depending on certain variables (such as metabolism, food interaction); however the effects can seem to last much longer due to psilocin's ability to distort the perception of time.

        "text2": "Title: Tryptamine\nwikipedia: Tryptamine is an indolamine metabolite of the essential amino acid tryptophan. The chemical structure is defined by an indole\u2014a fused benzene and pyrrole ring, and a 2-aminoethyl group at the second carbon (third aromatic atom, with the first one being the heterocyclic nitrogen). The structure of tryptamine is a shared feature of certain aminergic neuromodulators including melatonin, serotonin, bufotenin and psychedelic derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, psilocin and others.\nTryptamine has been shown to activate serotonin receptors and trace amine-associated receptors expressed in the mammalian brain, and regulates the activity of dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. In the human gut, symbiotic bacteria convert dietary tryptophan to tryptamine, which activates 5-HT4 receptors and regulates gastrointestinal motility.\nMultiple tryptamine-derived drugs have been developed to treat migraines, while trace amine-associated receptors are being explored as a potential treatment target for neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nNatural occurrences: For a list of plants, fungi and animals containing tryptamines, see List of psychoactive plants and List of naturally occurring tryptamines.\n\nMammalian brain: Endogenous levels of tryptamine in the mammalian brain are less than 100 ng per gram of tissue. However, elevated levels of trace amines have been observed in patients with certain neuropsychiatric disorders taking medications, such as bipolar depression and schizophrenia.\n\nMammalian gut microbiome: Tryptamine is relatively abundant in the gut and feces of humans and rodents. Commensal bacteria, including Ruminococcus gnavus and Clostridium sporogenes in the gastrointestinal tract, possess the enzyme tryptophan decarboxylase, which aids in the conversion of dietary tryptophan to tryptamine. Tryptamine is a ligand for gut epithelial serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptors and regulates gastrointestinal electrolyte balance through colonic secretions.\n\nMetabolism: \n\nBiosynthesis: To yield tryptamine in vivo, tryptophan decarboxylase removes the carboxylic acid group on the \u03b1-carbon of tryptophan. Synthetic modifications to tryptamine can produce serotonin and melatonin; however, these pathways do not occur naturally as the main pathway for endogenous neurotransmitter synthesis.\n\nCatabolism: Monoamine oxidases A and B are the primary enzymes involved in tryptamine metabolism to produce indole-3-acetaldehyde, however it is unclear which isoform is specific to tryptamine degradation.\n\nFigure: \n\nBiological activity: \n\nSerotonin receptor agonist: Tryptamine is known to act as a serotonin receptor agonist, although its potency is limited by rapid inactivation by monoamine oxidases. It has specifically been found to act as a full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 7.36 \u00b1 0.56 nM; Emax = 104 \u00b1 4%). Tryptamine was of much lower potency in stimulating the 5-HT2A receptor \u03b2-arrestin pathway (EC50 = 3,485 \u00b1 234 nM; Emax = 108 \u00b1 16%). In contrast to the 5-HT2A receptor, tryptamine was found to be inactive at the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor.\n\nGastrointestinal motility: Tryptamine produced by mutualistic bacteria in the human gut activates serotonin GPCRs ubiquitously expressed along the colonic epithelium. Upon tryptamine binding, the activated 5-HT4 receptor undergoes a conformational change which allows its Gs alpha subunit to exchange GDP for GTP, and its liberation from the 5-HT4 receptor and \u03b2\u03b3 subunit. GTP-bound Gs activates adenylyl cyclase, which catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP opens chloride and potassium ion channels to drive colonic electrolyte secretion and promote intestinal motility.\n\nTAAR1 agonist: Tryptamine can weakly activate the trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1 (hTAAR1 in humans). Limited studies have considered tryptamine to be a trace neuromodulator capable of regulating the activity of neuronal cell responses without binding to the associated postsynaptic receptors.\nhTAAR1 is a stimulatory G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that is weakly expressed in the intracellular compartment of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Tryptamine and other hTAAR1 agonists can increase neuronal firing by inhibiting neurotransmitter recycling through cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the monoamine reuptake transporter. This mechanism increases the amount of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft, subsequently increasing postsynaptic receptor binding and neuronal activation. Conversely, when hTAAR1 are colocalized with G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs), receptor activation reduces neuronal firing by facilitating membrane hyperpolarization through the efflux of potassium ions. The balance between the inhibitory and excitatory activity of hTAAR1 activation highlights the role of tryptamine in the regulation of neural activity.\nActivation of hTAAR1 is under investigation as a novel treatment for depression, addiction, and schizophrenia. hTAAR1 is primarily expressed in brain structures associated with dopamine systems, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and serotonin systems in the dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN). Additionally, the hTAAR1 gene is localized at 6q23.2 on the human chromosome, which is a susceptibility locus for mood disorders and schizophrenia. Activation of TAAR1 suggests a potential novel treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders, as TAAR1 agonists produce anti-depressive activity, increased cognition, reduced stress and anti-addiction effects.\n\nMonoamine releasing agent: Tryptamine has been found to act as a monoamine releasing agent. It is a releaser of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, in that order of potency (EC50 = 32.6 \u00b1 2.6 nM, 164 \u00b1 16 nM, and 716 \u00b1 46 nM, respectively).\n\nMonoaminergic activity enhancer: Tryptamine is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its serotonin receptor agonism. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The MAE actions of tryptamine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. Synthetic and more potent MAEs like benzofuranylpropylaminopentane (BPAP) and indolylpropylaminopentane (IPAP) have been derived from tryptamine.\n\nEffects in animals and humans: In a published clinical study, tryptamine, at a total dose of 23 to 277 mg by intravenous infusion, produced hallucinogenic effects or perceptual disturbances similar to those of small doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It also produced other LSD-like effects, including pupil dilation, increased blood pressure, and increased force of the patellar reflex. Tryptamine produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tingling sensations, sweating, and bodily heaviness among others as well. Conversely, there were no changes in heart rate or respiratory rate. The onset of the effects was rapid and the duration was very short. This can be attributed to the very rapid metabolism of tryptamine by monoamine oxidase (MAO) and its very short elimination half-life.\nIn animals, tryptamine, alone and/or in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), produces behavioral changes such as hyperlocomotion and reversal of reserpine-induced behavioral depression. In addition, it produces effects like hyperthermia, tachycardia, myoclonus, and seizures or convulsions, among others. Findings on tryptamine and the head-twitch response in rodents have been mixed, with some studies reporting no effect, some studies reporting induction of head twitches by tryptamine, and others reporting that tryptamine actually antagonized 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitches. Another study found that combination of tryptamine with an MAOI dose-dependently produced head twitches. Head twitches in rodents are a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects. Many of the effects of tryptamine can be reversed by serotonin receptor antagonists like metergoline, metitepine (methiothepin), and cyproheptadine. Conversely, the effects of tryptamine in animals are profoundly augmented by MAOIs due to inhibition of its metabolism.\nTryptamine seems to also elevate prolactin and cortisol levels in animals and/or humans.\nThe LD50Tooltip median lethal dose values of tryptamine in animals include 100 mg/kg i.p. in mice, 500 mg/kg s.c. in mice, and 223 mg/kg i.p. in rats.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Tryptamine produced endogenously or administered peripherally is readily able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. This is in contrast to serotonin, which is peripherally selective.\nTryptamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO) to form indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Its metabolism is described as extremely rapid and its elimination half-life and duration as very short. In addition, its duration is described as shorter than that of dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Brain tryptamine levels are increased up to 300-fold by MAOIs in animals. In addition, the effects of exogenous tryptamine are strongly augmented by monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).\nTryptamine is excreted in urine and its rate of urinary excretion has been reported to be pH-dependent.\n\nChemistry: Tryptamine is a substituted tryptamine derivative and trace amine and is structurally related to the amino acid tryptophan.\nThe experimental log P of tryptamine is 1.55.\n\nDerivatives: The endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT) and melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine), as well as trace amines like N-methyltryptamine (NMT), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and bufotenin (N,N-dimethylserotonin), are derivatives of tryptamine.\nA variety of drugs, including both naturally occurring and pharmaceutical substances, are derivatives of tryptamine. These include the tryptamine psychedelics like psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT; tryptamine stimulants, entactogens, psychedelics, and/or antidepressants like \u03b1-methyltryptamine (\u03b1MT) and \u03b1-ethyltryptamine (\u03b1ET); triptan antimigraine agents like sumatriptan; certain antipsychotics like oxypertine; and the sleep aid melatonin.\n\nVarious other drugs, including ergolines and lysergamides like the psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the antimigraine agents ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, and methysergide, and the antiparkinsonian agents bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, and pergolide; \u03b2-carbolines like harmine (some of which are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)); Iboga alkaloids like the hallucinogen ibogaine; yohimbans like the \u03b12 blocker yohimbine; antipsychotics like ciclindole and flucindole; and the MAOI antidepressant metralindole, can all be thought of as cyclized tryptamine derivatives.\nDrugs very closely related to tryptamines, but technically not tryptamines themselves, include certain triptans like avitriptan and naratriptan; the antipsychotics sertindole and tepirindole; and the MAOI antidepressants pirlindole and tetrindole.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Tryptamine FAQ\nTryptamine Hallucinogens and Consciousness\nTryptamind Psychoactives, reference site on tryptamine and other psychoactives.\nTryptamine (T) entry in TiHKAL \u2022 info\n\n\n pubchem:\nTryptamine is an aminoalkylindole consisting of indole having a 2-aminoethyl group at the 3-position.

        "text1": "Title: Formaldehyde\nwikipedia: Formaldehyde (  for-MAL-di-hide, US also   f\u0259r-) (systematic name methanal) is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH2O and structure H\u2212CHO, more precisely H2C=O. The compound is a pungent, colourless gas that polymerises spontaneously into paraformaldehyde. It is stored as aqueous solutions (formalin), which consists mainly of the hydrate CH2(OH)2. It is the simplest of the aldehydes (R\u2212CHO). As a precursor to many other materials and chemical compounds, in 2006 the global production of formaldehyde was estimated at 12 million tons per year. It is mainly used in the production of industrial resins, e.g., for particle board and coatings. Small amounts also occur naturally.\nFormaldehyde is classified as a carcinogen and can cause respiratory and skin irritation upon exposure.\n\nForms: Formaldehyde is more complicated than many simple carbon compounds in that it adopts several diverse forms. These compounds can often be used interchangeably and can be interconverted.\n\nMolecular formaldehyde. A colorless gas with a characteristic pungent, irritating odor. It is stable at about 150 \u00b0C, but polymerizes when condensed to a liquid.\n1,3,5-Trioxane, with the formula (CH2O)3. It is a white solid that dissolves without degradation in organic solvents. It is a trimer of molecular formaldehyde.\nParaformaldehyde, with the formula HO(CH2O)nH. It is a white solid that is insoluble in most solvents.\nMethanediol, with the formula CH2(OH)2. This compound also exists in equilibrium with various oligomers (short polymers), depending on the concentration and temperature. A saturated water solution, of about 40% formaldehyde by volume or 37% by mass, is called \"100% formalin\".\nA small amount of stabilizer, such as methanol, is usually added to suppress oxidation and polymerization. A typical commercial-grade formalin may contain 10\u201312% methanol in addition to various metallic impurities.\n\"Formaldehyde\" was first used as a generic trademark in 1893 following a previous trade name, \"formalin\".\n\n\tMain forms of formaldehyde\n\nStructure and bonding: Molecular formaldehyde contains a central carbon atom with a double bond to the oxygen atom and a single bond to each hydrogen atom. This structure is summarised by the condensed formula H2C=O. The molecule is planar, Y-shaped and its molecular symmetry belongs to the C2v point group. The precise molecular geometry of gaseous formaldehyde has been determined by gas electron diffraction and microwave spectroscopy. The bond lengths are 1.21 \u00c5 for the carbon\u2013oxygen bond and around 1.11 \u00c5 for the carbon\u2013hydrogen bond, while the H\u2013C\u2013H bond angle is 117\u00b0, close to the 120\u00b0 angle found in an ideal trigonal planar molecule. Some excited electronic states of formaldehyde are pyramidal rather than planar as in the ground state.\n\nOccurrence: Processes in the upper atmosphere contribute more than 80% of the total formaldehyde in the environment. Formaldehyde is an intermediate in the oxidation (or combustion) of methane, as well as of other carbon compounds, e.g. in forest fires, automobile exhaust, and tobacco smoke. When produced in the atmosphere by the action of sunlight and oxygen on atmospheric methane and other hydrocarbons, it becomes part of smog. Formaldehyde has also been detected in outer space.\nFormaldehyde and its adducts are ubiquitous in nature. Food may contain formaldehyde at levels 1\u2013100 mg/kg. Formaldehyde, formed in the metabolism of the amino acids serine and threonine, is found in the bloodstream of humans and other primates at concentrations of approximately 50 micromolar. Experiments in which animals are exposed to an atmosphere containing isotopically labeled formaldehyde have demonstrated that even in deliberately exposed animals, the majority of formaldehyde-DNA adducts found in non-respiratory tissues are derived from endogenously produced formaldehyde.\nFormaldehyde does not accumulate in the environment, because it is broken down within a few hours by sunlight or by bacteria present in soil or water. Humans metabolize formaldehyde quickly, converting it to formic acid, so it does not accumulate. It nonetheless presents significant health concerns, as a contaminant.\n\nInterstellar formaldehyde: Formaldehyde appears to be a useful probe in astrochemistry due to prominence of the 110\u2190111 and 211\u2190212 K-doublet transitions. It was the first polyatomic organic molecule detected in the interstellar medium. Since its initial detection in 1969, it has been observed in many regions of the galaxy. Because of the widespread interest in interstellar formaldehyde, it has been extensively studied, yielding new extragalactic sources. A proposed mechanism for the formation is the hydrogenation of CO ice:\n\nH + CO \u2192 HCO\nHCO + H \u2192 CH2O\nHCN, HNC, H2CO, and dust have also been observed inside the comae of comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON).\n\nSynthesis and industrial production: \n\nLaboratory synthesis: Formaldehyde was discovered in 1859 by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov (1828\u20131886) when he attempted to synthesize methanediol (\"methylene glycol\") from iodomethane and silver oxalate. In his paper, Butlerov referred to formaldehyde as \"dioxymethylen\" (methylene dioxide) because his empirical formula for it was incorrect, as atomic weights were not precisely determined until the Karlsruhe Congress.\nThe compound was identified as an aldehyde by August Wilhelm von Hofmann, who first announced its production by passing methanol vapor in air over hot platinum wire. With modifications, Hoffmann's method remains the basis of the present day industrial route.\nSolution routes to formaldehyde also entail oxidation of methanol or iodomethane.\n\nIndustry: Formaldehyde is produced industrially by the catalytic oxidation of methanol. The most common catalysts are silver metal, iron(III) oxide, iron molybdenum oxides (e.g. iron(III) molybdate) with a molybdenum-enriched surface, or vanadium oxides. In the commonly used formox process, methanol and oxygen react at c. 250\u2013400 \u00b0C in presence of iron oxide in combination with molybdenum and/or vanadium to produce formaldehyde according to the chemical equation:\n\n2 CH3OH + O2 \u2192 2 CH2O + 2 H2O\nThe silver-based catalyst usually operates at a higher temperature, about 650 \u00b0C. Two chemical reactions on it simultaneously produce formaldehyde: that shown above and the dehydrogenation reaction:\n\nCH3OH \u2192 CH2O + H2\nIn principle, formaldehyde could be generated by oxidation of methane, but this route is not industrially viable because the methanol is more easily oxidized than methane.\n\nBiochemistry: Formaldehyde is produced via several enzyme-catalyzed routes. Living beings, including humans, produce formaldehyde as part of their metabolism. Formaldehyde is key to several bodily functions (e.g. epigenetics), but its amount must also be tightly controlled to avoid self-poisoning.\n\nSerine hydroxymethyltransferase can decompose serine into formaldehyde and glycine, according to this reaction: HOCH2CH(NH2)CO2H \u2192 CH2O + H2C(NH2)CO2H.\nMethylotrophic microbes convert methanol into formaldehyde and energy via methanol dehydrogenase: CH3OH \u2192 CH2O + 2e\u2212 + 2H+\nOther routes to formaldehyde include oxidative demethylations, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidases, dimethylglycine dehydrogenases, lipid peroxidases, P450 oxidases, and N-methyl group demethylases.\nFormaldehyde is catabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase ADH5 and aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH2.\n\nOrganic chemistry: Formaldehyde is a building block in the synthesis of many other compounds of specialised and industrial significance. It exhibits most of the chemical properties of other aldehydes but is more reactive.\n\nPolymerization and hydration: Monomeric CH2O is a gas and is rarely encountered in the laboratory.  Aqueous formaldehyde, unlike some other small aldehydes (which need specific conditions to oligomerize through aldol condensation) oligomerizes spontaneously at a common state. The trimer 1,3,5-trioxane, (CH2O)3, is a typical oligomer. Many cyclic oligomers of other sizes have been isolated. Similarly, formaldehyde hydrates to give the geminal diol methanediol, which condenses further to form hydroxy-terminated oligomers HO(CH2O)nH. The polymer is called paraformaldehyde. The higher concentration of formaldehyde\u2014the more equilibrium shifts towards polymerization. Diluting with water or increasing the solution temperature, as well as adding alcohols (such as methanol or ethanol) lowers that tendency.\nGaseous formaldehyde polymerizes at active sites on vessel walls, but the mechanism of the reaction is unknown. Small amounts of hydrogen chloride, boron trifluoride, or stannic chloride present in gaseous formaldehyde provide the catalytic effect and make the polymerization rapid.\n\nCross-linking reactions: Formaldehyde forms cross-links by first combining with a protein to form methylol, which loses a water molecule to form a Schiff base. The Schiff base can then react with DNA or protein to create a cross-linked product. This reaction is the basis for the most common process of chemical fixation.\n\nOxidation and reduction: Formaldehyde is readily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen into formic acid. For this reason, commercial formaldehyde is typically contaminated with formic acid. Formaldehyde can be hydrogenated into methanol.\nIn the Cannizzaro reaction, formaldehyde and base react to produce formic acid and methanol, a disproportionation reaction.\n\nHydroxymethylation and chloromethylation: Formaldehyde reacts with many compounds, resulting in hydroxymethylation:\n\nX-H + CH2O \u2192 X-CH2OH     (X = R2N, RC(O)NR', SH).\nThe resulting hydroxymethyl derivatives typically react further. Thus, amines give hexahydro-1,3,5-triazines:\n\n3 RNH2 + 3 CH2O \u2192 (RNCH2)3 + 3 H2O\nSimilarly, when combined with hydrogen sulfide, it forms trithiane:\n\n3 CH2O + 3 H2S \u2192 (CH2S)3 + 3 H2O\nIn the presence of acids, it participates in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds resulting in hydroxymethylated derivatives:\n\nArH + CH2O \u2192 ArCH2OH\nWhen conducted in the presence of hydrogen chloride, the product is the chloromethyl compound, as described in the Blanc chloromethylation. If the arene is electron-rich, as in phenols, elaborate condensations ensue. With 4-substituted phenols one obtains calixarenes. Phenol results in polymers.\n\nOther reactions: Many amino acids react with formaldehyde. Cysteine converts to thioproline.\n\nUses: \n\nIndustrial applications: Formaldehyde is a common precursor to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from formaldehyde include urea formaldehyde resin, melamine resin, phenol formaldehyde resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant.\n\nWhen condensed with phenol, urea, or melamine, formaldehyde produces, respectively, hard thermoset phenol formaldehyde resin, urea formaldehyde resin, and melamine resin. These polymers are permanent adhesives used in plywood and carpeting. They are also foamed to make insulation, or cast into moulded products. Production of formaldehyde resins accounts for more than half of formaldehyde consumption.\nFormaldehyde is also a precursor to polyfunctional alcohols such as pentaerythritol, which is used to make paints and explosives. Other formaldehyde derivatives include methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, an important component in polyurethane paints and foams, and hexamine, which is used in phenol-formaldehyde resins as well as the explosive RDX.\nCondensation with acetaldehyde affords pentaerythritol, a chemical necessary in synthesizing PETN, a high explosive:\n\nNiche uses: \n\nDisinfectant and biocide: An aqueous solution of formaldehyde can be useful as a disinfectant as it kills most bacteria and fungi (including their spores). It is used as an additive in vaccine manufacturing to inactivate toxins and pathogens. Formaldehyde releasers are used as biocides in personal care products such as cosmetics. Although present at levels not normally considered harmful, they are known to cause allergic contact dermatitis in certain sensitised individuals.\nAquarists use formaldehyde as a treatment for the parasites Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Cryptocaryon irritans. Formaldehyde is one of the main disinfectants recommended for destroying anthrax.\nFormaldehyde is also approved for use in the manufacture of animal feeds in the US. It is an antimicrobial agent used to maintain complete animal feeds or feed ingredients Salmonella negative for up to 21 days.\n\nTissue fixative and embalming agent: Formaldehyde preserves or fixes tissue or cells. The process involves cross-linking of primary amino groups. The European Union has banned the use of formaldehyde as a biocide (including embalming) under the Biocidal Products Directive (98/8/EC) due to its carcinogenic properties. Countries with a strong tradition of embalming corpses, such as Ireland and other colder-weather countries, have raised concerns. Despite reports to the contrary, no decision on the inclusion of formaldehyde on Annex I of the Biocidal Products Directive for product-type 22 (embalming and taxidermist fluids) had been made as of September 2009.\nFormaldehyde-based crosslinking is exploited in ChIP-on-chip or ChIP-sequencing genomics experiments, where DNA-binding proteins are cross-linked to their cognate binding sites on the chromosome and analyzed to determine what genes are regulated by the proteins. Formaldehyde is also used as a denaturing agent in RNA gel electrophoresis, preventing RNA from forming secondary structures. A solution of 4% formaldehyde fixes pathology tissue specimens at about one mm per hour at room temperature.\n\nDrug testing: Formaldehyde and 18 M (concentrated) sulfuric acid makes Marquis reagent\u2014which can identify alkaloids and other compounds.\n\nPhotography: In photography, formaldehyde is used in low concentrations for the process C-41 (color negative film) stabilizer in the final wash step, as well as in the process E-6 pre-bleach step, to make it unnecessary in the final wash. Due to improvements in dye coupler chemistry, more modern (2006 or later) E-6 and C-41 films do not need formaldehyde, as their dyes are already stable.\n\nSafety: In view of its widespread use, toxicity, and volatility, formaldehyde poses a significant danger to human health. In 2011, the US National Toxicology Program described formaldehyde as \"known to be a human carcinogen\".\n\nChronic inhalation: Concerns are associated with chronic (long-term) exposure by inhalation as may happen from thermal or chemical decomposition of formaldehyde-based resins and the production of formaldehyde resulting from the combustion of a variety of organic compounds (for example, exhaust gases). As formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, it is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 ppm in air, formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes. Formaldehyde inhaled at this concentration may cause headaches, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing, and can trigger or aggravate asthma symptoms.\nThe CDC considers formaldehyde as a systemic poison. Formaldehyde poisoning can cause permanent changes in the nervous system's functions.\nA 1988 Canadian study of houses with urea-formaldehyde foam insulation found that formaldehyde levels as low as 0.046 ppm were positively correlated with eye and nasal irritation.\nA 2009 review of studies has shown a strong association between exposure to formaldehyde and the development of childhood asthma.\nA theory was proposed for the carcinogenesis of formaldehyde in 1978. In 1987 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified it as a probable human carcinogen, and after more studies the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 1995 also classified it as a probable human carcinogen. Further information and evaluation of all known data led the IARC to reclassify formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen associated with nasal sinus cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer. Studies in 2009 and 2010 have also shown a positive correlation between exposure to formaldehyde and the development of leukemia, particularly myeloid leukemia. Nasopharyngeal and sinonasal cancers are relatively rare, with a combined annual incidence in the United States of < 4,000 cases. About 30,000 cases of myeloid leukemia occur in the United States each year. Some evidence suggests that workplace exposure to formaldehyde contributes to sinonasal cancers. Professionals exposed to formaldehyde in their occupation, such as funeral industry workers and embalmers, showed an increased risk of leukemia and brain cancer compared with the general population. Other factors are important in determining individual risk for the development of leukemia or nasopharyngeal cancer. In yeast, formaldehyde is found to perturb pathways for DNA repair and cell cycle.\nIn the residential environment, formaldehyde exposure comes from a number of routes; formaldehyde can be emitted by treated wood products, such as plywood or particle board, but it is produced by paints, varnishes, floor finishes, and cigarette smoking as well. In July 2016, the U.S. EPA released a prepublication version of its final rule on Formaldehyde Emission Standards for Composite Wood Products. These new rules impact manufacturers, importers, distributors, and retailers of products containing composite wood, including fiberboard, particleboard, and various laminated products, who must comply with more stringent record-keeping and labeling requirements.\n\nThe U.S. EPA allows no more than 0.016 ppm formaldehyde in the air in new buildings constructed for that agency. A U.S. EPA study found a new home measured 0.076 ppm when brand new and 0.045 ppm after 30 days. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has also announced limits on the formaldehyde levels in trailers purchased by that agency. The EPA recommends the use of \"exterior-grade\" pressed-wood products with phenol instead of urea resin to limit formaldehyde exposure, since pressed-wood products containing formaldehyde resins are often a significant source of formaldehyde in homes.\nThe eyes are most sensitive to formaldehyde exposure: The lowest level at which many people can begin to smell formaldehyde ranges between 0.05 and 1 ppm. The maximum concentration value at the workplace is 0.3 ppm. In controlled chamber studies, individuals begin to sense eye irritation at about 0.5 ppm; 5 to 20 percent report eye irritation at 0.5 to 1 ppm; and greater certainty for sensory irritation occurred at 1 ppm and above. While some agencies have used a level as low as 0.1 ppm as a threshold for irritation, the expert panel found that a level of 0.3 ppm would protect against nearly all irritation. In fact, the expert panel found that a level of 1.0 ppm would avoid eye irritation\u2014the most sensitive endpoint\u2014in 75\u201395% of all people exposed.\n\nFormaldehyde levels in building environments are affected by a number of factors. These include the potency of formaldehyde-emitting products present, the ratio of the surface area of emitting materials to volume of space, environmental factors, product age, interactions with other materials, and ventilation conditions. Formaldehyde emits from a variety of construction materials, furnishings, and consumer products. The three products that emit the highest concentrations are medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and particle board. Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity can elevate levels because formaldehyde has a high vapor pressure. Formaldehyde levels from building materials are the highest when a building first opens because materials would have less time to off-gas. Formaldehyde levels decrease over time as the sources suppress.\nIn operating rooms, formaldehyde is produced as a byproduct of electrosurgery and is present in surgical smoke, exposing surgeons and healthcare workers to potentially unsafe concentrations.\nFormaldehyde levels in air can be sampled and tested in several ways, including impinger, treated sorbent, and passive monitors. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has measurement methods numbered 2016, 2541, 3500, and 3800.\nIn June 2011, the twelfth edition of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Report on Carcinogens (RoC) changed the listing status of formaldehyde from \"reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\" to \"known to be a human carcinogen.\" Concurrently, a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) committee was convened and issued an independent review of the draft U.S. EPA IRIS assessment of formaldehyde, providing a comprehensive health effects assessment and quantitative estimates of human risks of adverse effects.\n\nAcute irritation and allergic reaction: For most people, irritation from formaldehyde is temporary and reversible, although formaldehyde can cause allergies and is part of the standard patch test series. In 2005\u201306, it was the seventh-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (9.0%). People with formaldehyde allergy are advised to avoid formaldehyde releasers as well (e.g., Quaternium-15, imidazolidinyl urea, and diazolidinyl urea). People who suffer allergic reactions to formaldehyde tend to display lesions on the skin in the areas that have had direct contact with the substance, such as the neck or thighs (often due to formaldehyde released from permanent press finished clothing) or dermatitis on the face (typically from cosmetics). Formaldehyde has been banned in cosmetics in both Sweden and Japan.\n\nOther routes: Formaldehyde occurs naturally, and is \"an essential intermediate in cellular metabolism in mammals and humans.\" According to the American Chemistry Council, \"Formaldehyde is found in every living system\u2014from plants to animals to humans. It metabolizes quickly in the body, breaks down rapidly, is not persistent and does not accumulate in the body.\"\nThe twelfth edition of NTP Report on Carcinogens notes that \"food and water contain measureable concentrations of formaldehyde, but the significance of ingestion as a source of formaldehyde exposure for the general population is questionable.\" Food formaldehyde generally occurs in a bound form and formaldehyde is unstable in an aqueous solution.\nIn humans, ingestion of as little as 30 millilitres (1.0 US fl oz) of 37% formaldehyde solution can cause death. Other symptoms associated with ingesting such a solution include gastrointestinal damage (vomiting, abdominal pain), and systematic damage (dizziness). Testing for formaldehyde is by blood and/or urine by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. Other methods include infrared detection, gas detector tubes, etc., of which high-performance liquid chromatography is the most sensitive.\n\nRegulation: Several web articles claim that formaldehyde has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. That is a misconception, as formaldehyde is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, formaldehyde is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of formaldehyde in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains formaldehyde.\nIn the United States, Congress passed a bill July 7, 2010, regarding the use of formaldehyde in hardwood plywood, particle board, and medium density fiberboard. The bill limited the allowable amount of formaldehyde emissions from these wood products to 0.09 ppm, and required companies to meet this standard by January 2013. The final U.S. EPA rule specified maximum emissions of \"0.05 ppm formaldehyde for hardwood plywood, 0.09 ppm formaldehyde for particleboard, 0.11 ppm formaldehyde for medium-density fiberboard, and 0.13 ppm formaldehyde for thin medium-density fiberboard.\"\nFormaldehyde was declared a toxic substance by the 1999 Canadian Environmental Protection Act.\nThe FDA is proposing a ban on hair relaxers with formaldehyde due to cancer concerns.\n\nContaminant in food: Scandals have broken in both the 2005 Indonesia food scare and 2007 Vietnam food scare regarding the addition of formaldehyde to foods to extend shelf life. In 2011, after a four-year absence, Indonesian authorities found foods with formaldehyde being sold in markets in a number of regions across the country. In August 2011, at least at two Carrefour supermarkets, the Central Jakarta Livestock and Fishery Sub-Department found cendol containing 10 parts per million of formaldehyde. In 2014, the owner of two noodle factories in Bogor, Indonesia, was arrested for using formaldehyde in noodles. 50 kg of formaldehyde was confiscated. Foods known to be contaminated included noodles, salted fish, and tofu. Chicken and beer were also rumored to be contaminated. In some places, such as China, manufacturers still use formaldehyde illegally as a preservative in foods, which exposes people to formaldehyde ingestion. In the early 1900s, it was frequently added by US milk plants to milk bottles as a method of pasteurization due to the lack of knowledge and concern regarding formaldehyde's toxicity.\nIn 2011 in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, truckloads of rotten chicken were treated with formaldehyde for sale in which \"a large network\", including 11 slaughterhouses run by a criminal gang, were implicated. In 2012, 1 billion rupiah (almost US$100,000) of fish imported from Pakistan to Batam, Indonesia, were found laced with formaldehyde.\nFormalin contamination of foods has been reported in Bangladesh, with stores and supermarkets selling fruits, fishes, and vegetables that have been treated with formalin to keep them fresh. However, in 2015, a Formalin Control Bill was passed in the Parliament of Bangladesh with a provision of life-term imprisonment as the maximum punishment as well as a maximum fine of 2,000,000 BDT but not less than 500,000 BDT for importing, producing, or hoarding formalin without a license.\nFormaldehyde was one of the chemicals used in 19th century industrialised food production that was investigated by Dr. Harvey W.

It is also known as methanal, methylene oxide, oxymethyline, methylaldehyde, and oxomethane. Formaldehyde is naturally produced in small amounts in our bodies. It is used in the production of fertilizer, paper, plywood, and urea-formaldehyde resins. It is also used as a preservative in some foods and in many products used around the house, such as antiseptics, medicines, and cosmetics.\nFormaldehyde (gas) can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\nSolids containing varying amounts of formaldehyde, probably as paraformaldehyde (polymers of formula HO(CH2O)xH where x averages about 30).

Contains 37-50% formaldehyde by mass and varying amounts of methanol, added to prevent precipitation of formaldehyde polymers (formaldehyde exists in solution as CH2(OH)2 and its polymers HO(CH2O)xH where x averages about three). Formalin free of methanol is also shipped but must be kept warm (about 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F)) to prevent polymerization. Pure formaldehyde, a gas, is not handled commercially because it tends to polymerize exothermally and may ignite. Vapor from formalin solution is flammable and an explosion hazard when exposed to flame or heat. Skin and eye irritant. Confirmed carcinogen.\nFormaldehyde is an aldehyde resulting from the formal oxidation of methanol.

Exposure to formaldehyde may occur by breathing contaminated indoor air, tobacco smoke, or ambient urban air. Acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to formaldehyde in humans can result in respiratory symptoms, and eye, nose, and throat irritation.

(From Reynolds, Martindale The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p717) -- Pubchem; The chemical compound formaldehyde (also known as methanal), is a gas with a pungent smell. It is the simplest aldehyde. Its chemical formula is H2CO. Formaldehyde was first synthesized by the Russian chemist Aleksandr Butlerov in 1859 but was conclusively identified by August Wilhelm van Hofmann in 1867. Although formaldehyde is a gas at room temperature, it is readily soluble in water, and it is most commonly sold as a 37% solution in water called by trade names such as formalin or formol. In water, formaldehyde polymerizes, and formalin actually contains very little formaldehyde in the form of H2CO monomer. Usually, these solutions contain a few percent methanol to limit the extent of polymerization. Formaldehyde exhibits most of the general chemical properties of the aldehydes, except that is generally more reactive than other aldehydes. Formaldehyde is a potent electrophile. It can participate in electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions with aromatic compounds and can undergo electrophilic addition reactions with alkenes. In the presence of basic catalysts, formaldehyde undergoes a Cannizaro reaction to produce formic acid and methanol. Because formaldehyde resins are used in many construction materials, including plywood, carpet, and spray-on insulating foams, and because these resins slowly give off formaldehyde over time, formaldehyde is one of the more common indoor air pollutants. At concentrations above 0.1 mg/kg in air, inhaled formaldehyde can irritate the eyes and mucous membranes, resulting in watery eyes, headache, a burning sensation in the throat, and difficulty breathing. -- Wikipedia.\nFormaldehyde is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nA highly reactive aldehyde gas formed by oxidation or incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons.

        "text2": "Title: Urea\nwikipedia: Urea, also called carbamide (because it is a diamide of carbonic acid), is an organic compound with chemical formula CO(NH2)2. This amide has two amino groups (\u2013NH2) joined by a carbonyl functional group (\u2013C(=O)\u2013). It is thus the simplest amide of carbamic acid.\nUrea serves an important role in the cellular metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds by animals and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in the urine of mammals. Urea is Neo-Latin, from French  ur\u00e9e, from Ancient Greek  \u03bf\u1f56\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (o\u00fbron) 'urine', itself from Proto-Indo-European *h\u2082worsom.\nIt is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic (LD50 is 15 g/kg for rats). Dissolved in water, it is neither acidic nor alkaline. The body uses it in many processes, most notably nitrogen excretion. The liver forms it by combining two ammonia molecules (NH3) with a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule in the urea cycle. Urea is widely used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen (N) and is an important raw material for the chemical industry.\nIn 1828, Friedrich W\u00f6hler discovered that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials, which was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry. This showed for the first time that a substance previously known only as a byproduct of life could be synthesized in the laboratory without biological starting materials, thereby contradicting the widely held doctrine of vitalism, which stated that only living organisms could produce the chemicals of life.\n\nProperties: \n\nMolecular and crystal structure: The structure of the molecule of urea is O=C(\u2212NH2)2. The urea molecule is planar when in a solid crystal because of sp2 hybridization of the N orbitals. It is non-planar with C2 symmetry when in the gas phase or in aqueous solution, with C\u2013N\u2013H and H\u2013N\u2013H bond angles that are intermediate between the trigonal planar angle of 120\u00b0 and the tetrahedral angle of 109.5\u00b0. In solid urea, the oxygen center is engaged in two N\u2013H\u2013O hydrogen bonds. The resulting hydrogen-bond network is probably established at the cost of efficient molecular packing: The structure is quite open, the ribbons forming tunnels with square cross-section. The carbon in urea is described as sp2 hybridized, the C-N bonds have significant double bond character, and the carbonyl oxygen is relatively basic. Urea's high aqueous solubility reflects its ability to engage in extensive hydrogen bonding with water.\nBy virtue of its tendency to form porous frameworks, urea has the ability to trap many organic compounds. In these so-called clathrates, the organic \"guest\" molecules are held in channels formed by interpenetrating helices composed of hydrogen-bonded urea molecules.  In this way, urea-clathrates have been well investigated for separations.\n\nReactions: Urea is a weak base, with a pKb of 13.9. When combined with strong acids, it undergoes protonation at oxygen to form uronium salts. It is also a Lewis base, forming metal complexes of the type [M(urea)6]n+.\nUrea reacts with malonic esters to make barbituric acids.\n\nThermolysis: Molten urea decomposes into ammonium cyanate at about 152 \u00b0C, and into ammonia and isocyanic acid above 160 \u00b0C:\n\nCO(NH2)2 \u2192 [NH4]+[OCN]\u2212 \u2192 NH3 + HNCO\nHeating above 160 \u00b0C yields biuret NH2CONHCONH2 and triuret NH2CONHCONHCONH2 via reaction with isocyanic acid:\n\nCO(NH2)2 + HNCO \u2192 NH2CONHCONH2\nNH2CONHCONH2 + HNCO \u2192 NH2CONHCONHCONH2\nAt higher temperatures it converts to a range of condensation products, including cyanuric acid (CNOH)3, guanidine HNC(NH2)2, and melamine.\n\nAqueous stability: In aqueous solution, urea slowly equilibrates with ammonium cyanate. This elimination reaction cogenerates isocyanic acid, which can carbamylate proteins, in particular the N-terminal amino group, the side chain amino of lysine, and to a lesser extent the side chains of arginine and cysteine. Each carbamylation event adds 43 daltons to the mass of the protein, which can be observed in protein mass spectrometry. For this reason, pure urea solutions should be freshly prepared and used, as aged solutions may develop a significant concentration of cyanate (20 mM in 8 M urea). Dissolving urea in ultrapure water followed by removing ions (i.e. cyanate) with a mixed-bed ion-exchange resin and storing that solution at 4 \u00b0C is a recommended preparation procedure. However, cyanate will build back up to significant levels within a few days. Alternatively, adding 25\u201350 mM ammonium chloride to a concentrated urea solution decreases formation of cyanate because of the common ion effect.\n\nAnalysis: Urea is readily quantified by a number of different methods, such as the diacetyl monoxime colorimetric method, and the Berthelot reaction (after initial conversion of urea to ammonia via urease). These methods are amenable to high throughput instrumentation, such as automated flow injection analyzers and 96-well micro-plate spectrophotometers.\n\nRelated compounds: Ureas describes a class of chemical compounds that share the same functional group, a carbonyl group attached to two organic amine residues: R1R2N\u2212C(=O)\u2212NR3R4, where R1, R2, R3 and R4 groups are hydrogen (\u2013H), organyl or other groups. Examples include carbamide peroxide, allantoin, and hydantoin. Ureas are closely related to biurets and related in structure to amides, carbamates, carbodiimides, and thiocarbamides.\n\nUses: \n\nAgriculture: More than 90% of world industrial production of urea is destined for use as a nitrogen-release fertilizer. Urea has the highest nitrogen content of all solid nitrogenous fertilizers in common use. Therefore, it has a low transportation cost per unit of nitrogen nutrient. The most common impurity of synthetic urea is biuret, which impairs plant growth. Urea breaks down in the soil to give ammonium ions (NH+4). The ammonium is taken up by the plant through its roots. In some soils, the ammonium is oxidized by bacteria to give nitrate (NO\u22123), which is also a nitrogen-rich plant nutrient. The loss of nitrogenous compounds to the atmosphere and runoff is wasteful and environmentally damaging so urea is sometimes modified to enhance the efficiency of its agricultural use. Techniques to make controlled-release fertilizers that slow the release of nitrogen include the encapsulation of urea in an inert sealant, and conversion of urea into derivatives such as urea-formaldehyde compounds, which degrade into ammonia at a pace matching plants' nutritional requirements.\n\nResins: Urea is a raw material for the manufacture of formaldehyde based resins, such as UF, MUF, and MUPF, used mainly in wood-based panels, for instance, particleboard, fiberboard, OSB, and plywood.\n\nExplosives: Urea can be used in a reaction with nitric acid to make urea nitrate, a high explosive that is used industrially and as part of some improvised explosive devices.\n\nAutomobile systems: Urea is used in Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) reactions to reduce the NOx pollutants in exhaust gases from combustion from diesel, dual fuel, and lean-burn natural gas engines. The BlueTec system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. Ammonia (NH3) produced by the hydrolysis of urea reacts with nitrogen oxides (NOx) and is converted into nitrogen gas (N2) and water within the catalytic converter. The conversion of noxious NOx to innocuous N2 is described by the following simplified global equation:\n\n4 NO + 4 NH3 + O2 \u2192 4 N2 + 6 H2O\nWhen urea is used, a pre-reaction (hydrolysis) occurs to first convert it to ammonia:\n\nCO(NH2)2 + H2O \u2192 2 NH3 + CO2\nBeing a solid highly soluble in water (545 g/L at 25 \u00b0C), urea is much easier and safer to handle and store than the more irritant, caustic and hazardous ammonia (NH3), so it is the reactant of choice. Trucks and cars using these catalytic converters need to carry a supply of diesel exhaust fluid, also sold as AdBlue, a solution of urea in water.\n\nLaboratory uses: Urea in concentrations up to 10 M is a powerful protein denaturant as it disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited to increase the solubility of some proteins. A mixture of urea and choline chloride is used as a deep eutectic solvent (DES), a substance similar to ionic liquid. When used in a deep eutectic solvent, urea gradually denatures the proteins that are solubilized.\nUrea in concentrations up to 8 M can be used to make fixed brain tissue transparent to visible light while still preserving fluorescent signals from labeled cells. This allows for much deeper imaging of neuronal processes than previously obtainable using conventional one photon or two photon confocal microscopes.\n\nMedical use: Urea-containing creams are used as topical dermatological products to promote rehydration of the skin. Urea 40% is indicated for psoriasis, xerosis, onychomycosis, ichthyosis, eczema, keratosis, keratoderma, corns, and calluses. If covered by an occlusive dressing, 40% urea preparations may also be used for nonsurgical debridement of nails. Urea 40% \"dissolves the intercellular matrix\" of the nail plate. Only diseased or dystrophic nails are removed, as there is no effect on healthy portions of the nail. This drug (as carbamide peroxide) is also used as an earwax removal aid.\nUrea has also been studied as a diuretic. It was first used by Dr. W. Friedrich in 1892. In a 2010 study of ICU patients, urea was used to treat euvolemic hyponatremia and was found safe, inexpensive, and simple.\nLike saline, urea has been injected into the uterus to induce abortion, although this method is no longer in widespread use.\nThe blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test is a measure of the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from urea. It is used as a marker of renal function, though it is inferior to other markers such as creatinine because blood urea levels are influenced by other factors such as diet, dehydration, and liver function.\nUrea has also been studied as an excipient in Drug-coated Balloon (DCB) coating formulation to enhance local drug delivery to stenotic blood vessels. Urea, when used as an excipient in small doses (~3 \u03bcg/mm2) to coat DCB surface was found to form crystals that increase drug transfer without adverse toxic effects on vascular endothelial cells.\nUrea labeled with carbon-14 or carbon-13 is used in the urea breath test, which is used to detect the presence of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in the stomach and duodenum of humans, associated with peptic ulcers. The test detects the characteristic enzyme urease, produced by H. pylori, by a reaction that produces ammonia from urea. This increases the pH (reduces the acidity) of the stomach environment around the bacteria. Similar bacteria species to H. pylori can be identified by the same test in animals such as apes, dogs, and cats (including big cats).\n\nMiscellaneous uses: An ingredient in diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), which is 32.5% urea and 67.5% de-ionized water.

The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase; the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The first step in the conversion of amino acids into metabolic waste in the liver is removal of the alpha-amino nitrogen, which produces ammonia. Because ammonia is toxic, it is excreted immediately by fish, converted into uric acid by birds, and converted into urea by mammals.\nAmmonia (NH3) is a common byproduct of the metabolism of nitrogenous compounds. Ammonia is smaller, more volatile, and more mobile than urea. If allowed to accumulate, ammonia would raise the pH in cells to toxic levels. Therefore, many organisms convert ammonia to urea, even though this synthesis has a net energy cost. Being practically neutral and highly soluble in water, urea is a safe vehicle for the body to transport and excrete excess nitrogen.\nUrea is synthesized in the body of many organisms as part of the urea cycle, either from the oxidation of amino acids or from ammonia. In this cycle, amino groups donated by ammonia and L-aspartate are converted to urea, while L-ornithine, citrulline, L-argininosuccinate, and L-arginine act as intermediates. Urea production occurs in the liver and is regulated by N-acetylglutamate. Urea is then dissolved into the blood (in the reference range of 2.5 to 6.7 mmol/L) and further transported and excreted by the kidney as a component of urine. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with sodium chloride and water) in sweat.\nIn water, the amine groups undergo slow displacement by water molecules, producing ammonia, ammonium ions, and bicarbonate ions. For this reason, old, stale urine has a stronger odor than fresh urine.\n\nHumans: The cycling of and excretion of urea by the kidneys is a vital part of mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also plays a role in the countercurrent exchange system of the nephrons, that allows for reabsorption of water and critical ions from the excreted urine. Urea is reabsorbed in the inner medullary collecting ducts of the nephrons, thus raising the osmolarity in the medullary interstitium surrounding the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle, which makes the water reabsorb.\nBy action of the urea transporter 2, some of this reabsorbed urea eventually flows back into the thin descending limb of the tubule, through the collecting ducts, and into the excreted urine. The body uses this mechanism, which is controlled by the antidiuretic hormone, to create hyperosmotic urine \u2014 i.e., urine with a higher concentration of dissolved substances than the blood plasma. This mechanism is important to prevent the loss of water, maintain blood pressure, and maintain a suitable concentration of sodium ions in the blood plasma.\nThe equivalent nitrogen content (in grams) of urea (in mmol) can be estimated by the conversion factor 0.028 g/mmol. Furthermore, 1 gram of nitrogen is roughly equivalent to 6.25 grams of protein, and 1 gram of protein is roughly equivalent to 5 grams of muscle tissue. In situations such as muscle wasting, 1 mmol of excessive urea in the urine (as measured by urine volume in litres multiplied by urea concentration in mmol/L) roughly corresponds to a muscle loss of 0.67 gram.\n\nOther species: In aquatic organisms the most common form of nitrogen waste is ammonia, whereas land-dwelling organisms convert the toxic ammonia to either urea or uric acid. Urea is found in the urine of mammals and amphibians, as well as some fish. Birds and saurian reptiles have a different form of nitrogen metabolism that requires less water, and leads to nitrogen excretion in the form of uric acid. Tadpoles excrete ammonia, but shift to urea production during metamorphosis. Despite the generalization above, the urea pathway has been documented not only in mammals and amphibians, but in many other organisms as well, including birds, invertebrates, insects, plants, yeast, fungi, and even microorganisms.\n\nAdverse effects: Urea can be irritating to skin, eyes, and the respiratory tract. Repeated or prolonged contact with urea in fertilizer form on the skin may cause dermatitis.\nHigh concentrations in the blood can be damaging. Ingestion of low concentrations of urea, such as are found in typical human urine, are not dangerous with additional water ingestion within a reasonable time-frame. Many animals (e.g. camels, rodents or dogs) have a much more concentrated urine which may contain a higher urea amount than normal human urine.\nUrea can cause algal blooms to produce toxins, and its presence in the runoff from fertilized land may play a role in the increase of toxic blooms.\nThe substance decomposes on heating above melting point, producing toxic gases, and reacts violently with strong oxidants, nitrites, inorganic chlorides, chlorites and perchlorates, causing fire and explosion.\n\nHistory: Urea was first discovered in urine in 1727 by the Dutch scientist Herman Boerhaave, although this discovery is often attributed to the French chemist Hilaire Rouelle as well as William Cruickshank.\nBoerhaave used the following steps to isolate urea:\n\nBoiled off water, resulting in a substance similar to fresh cream\nUsed filter paper to squeeze out remaining liquid\nWaited a year for solid to form under an oily liquid\nRemoved the oily liquid\nDissolved the solid in water\nUsed recrystallization to tease out the urea\nIn 1828, the German chemist Friedrich W\u00f6hler obtained urea artificially by treating silver cyanate with ammonium chloride.\n\nAgNCO + [NH4]Cl \u2192 CO(NH2)2 + AgCl\nThis was the first time an organic compound was artificially synthesized from inorganic starting materials, without the involvement of living organisms. The results of this experiment implicitly discredited vitalism, the theory that the chemicals of living organisms are fundamentally different from those of inanimate matter. This insight was important for the development of organic chemistry. His discovery prompted W\u00f6hler to write triumphantly to J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius:\n\n\"I must tell you that I can make urea without the use of kidneys, either man or dog. Ammonium cyanate is urea.\"\nIn fact, his second sentence was incorrect. Ammonium cyanate [NH4]+[OCN]\u2212 and urea CO(NH2)2 are two different chemicals with the same empirical formula CON2H4, which are in chemical equilibrium heavily favoring urea under standard conditions. Regardless, with his discovery, W\u00f6hler secured a place among the pioneers of organic chemistry.\nUremic frost was first described in 1865 by Harald Hirschsprung, the first Danish pediatrician in 1870 who also described the disease that carries his name in 1886. Uremic frost has become rare since the advent of dialysis. It is the classical pre-dialysis era description of crystallized urea deposits over the skin of patients with prolonged kidney failure and severe uremia.\n\nHistorical preparation: Urea was first noticed by Herman Boerhaave in the early 18th century from evaporates of urine. In 1773, Hilaire Rouelle obtained crystals containing urea from human urine by evaporating it and treating it with alcohol in successive filtrations. This method was aided by Carl Wilhelm Scheele's discovery that urine treated by concentrated nitric acid precipitated crystals. Antoine Fran\u00e7ois, comte de Fourcroy and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin discovered in 1799 that the nitrated crystals were identical to Rouelle's substance and invented the term \"urea.\" Berzelius made further improvements to its purification and finally William Prout, in 1817, succeeded in obtaining and determining the chemical composition of the pure substance. In the evolved procedure, urea was precipitated as urea nitrate by adding strong nitric acid to urine. To purify the resulting crystals, they were dissolved in boiling water with charcoal and filtered. After cooling, pure crystals of urea nitrate form. To reconstitute the urea from the nitrate, the crystals are dissolved in warm water, and barium carbonate added. The water is then evaporated and anhydrous alcohol added to extract the urea. This solution is drained off and evaporated, leaving pure urea.\n\nLaboratory preparation: Ureas in the more general sense can be accessed in the laboratory by reaction of phosgene with primary or secondary amines:\n\nCOCl2 + 4 RNH2 \u2192 (RNH)2CO + 2 [RNH3]+Cl\u2212\nThese reactions proceed through an isocyanate intermediate. Non-symmetric ureas can be accessed by the reaction of primary or secondary amines with an isocyanate.\nUrea can also be produced by heating ammonium cyanate to 60 \u00b0C.\n\n[NH4]+[OCN]\u2212 \u2192 (NH2)2CO\n\nIndustrial production: In 2020, worldwide production capacity was approximately 180 million tonnes.\nFor use in industry, urea is produced from synthetic ammonia and carbon dioxide. As large quantities of carbon dioxide are produced during the ammonia manufacturing process as a byproduct of burning hydrocarbons to generate heat (predominantly natural gas, and less often petroleum derivatives or coal), urea production plants are almost always located adjacent to the site where the ammonia is manufactured.\n\nSynthesis: The basic process, patented in 1922, is called the Bosch\u2013Meiser urea process after its discoverers Carl Bosch and Wilhelm Meiser. The process consists of two main equilibrium reactions, with incomplete conversion of the reactants. The first is carbamate formation: the fast exothermic reaction of liquid ammonia with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) at high temperature and pressure to form ammonium carbamate ([NH4]+[NH2COO]\u2212):\n\n2 NH3 + CO2 \u21cc NH4CO2NH2     (\u0394H = \u2212117 kJ/mol at 110 atm and 160 \u00b0C)\nThe second is urea conversion: the slower endothermic decomposition of ammonium carbamate into urea and water:\n\nNH4CO2NH2 \u21cc CO(NH2)2 + H2O     (\u0394H = +15.5 kJ/mol at 160\u2013180 \u00b0C)\nThe overall conversion of NH3 and CO2 to urea is exothermic, with the reaction heat from the first reaction driving the second. The conditions that favor urea formation (high temperature) have an unfavorable effect on the carbamate formation equilibrium. The process conditions are a compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature (around 190 \u00b0C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the process under high pressure (140\u2013175 bar), which favors the first reaction. Although it is necessary to compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure, the ammonia is available from the ammonia production plant in liquid form, which can be pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation reaction time to reach equilibrium, a large reaction space is needed, so the synthesis reactor in a large urea plant tends to be a massive pressure vessel.\n\nReactant recycling: Because the urea conversion is incomplete, the urea must be separated from the unconverted reactants, including the ammonium carbamate. Various commercial urea processes are characterized by the conditions under which urea forms and the way that unconverted reactants are further processed.\n\nConventional recycle processes: In early \"straight-through\" urea plants, reactant recovery (the first step in \"recycling\") was done by letting down the system pressure to atmospheric to let the carbamate decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, because it was not economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia at least would be used for the manufacture of other products such as ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfate, and the carbon dioxide was usually wasted. Later process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical. This was accomplished by the \"total recycle process\", developed in the 1940s to 1960s and now called the \"conventional recycle process\". It proceeds by depressurizing the reaction solution in stages (first to 18\u201325 bar and then to 2\u20135 bar) and passing it at each stage through a steam-heated carbamate decomposer, then recombining the resulting carbon dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film carbamate condenser and pumping the carbamate solution back into the urea reaction vessel.\n\nStripping recycle process: The \"conventional recycle process\" for recovering and reusing the reactants has largely been supplanted by a stripping process, developed in the early 1960s by Stamicarbon in The Netherlands, that operates at or near the full pressure of the reaction vessel. It reduces the complexity of the multi-stage recycle scheme, and it reduces the amount of water recycled in the carbamate solution, which has an adverse effect on the equilibrium in the urea conversion reaction and thus on overall plant efficiency. Effectively all new urea plants use the stripper, and many total recycle urea plants have converted to a stripping process.\nIn the conventional recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide, allowing these gasses to be separated from the urea product solution. The stripping process achieves a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure, by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants in order to promote carbamate decomposition. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the urea synthesis reactor with the ammonia, as in the conventional process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through the stripper. The stripper is a carbamate decomposer that provides a large amount of gas-liquid contact. This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor is passed to the urea production reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the conventional recycle process.\n\nSide reactions: The three main side reactions that produce impurities have in common that they decompose urea.\nUrea hydrolyzes back to ammonium carbamate in the hottest stages of the synthesis plant, especially in the stripper, so residence times in these stages are designed to be short.\nBiuret is formed when two molecules of urea combine with the loss of a molecule of ammonia.\n\n2 NH2CONH2 \u2192 NH2CONHCONH2 + NH3\nNormally this reaction is suppressed in the synthesis reactor by maintaining an excess of ammonia, but after the stripper, it occurs until the temperature is reduced. Biuret is undesirable in urea fertilizer because it is toxic to crop plants to varying degrees, but it is sometimes desirable as a nitrogen source when used in animal feed.\nIsocyanic acid HNCO and ammonia NH3 results from the thermal decomposition of ammonium cyanate [NH4]+[OCN]\u2212, which is in chemical equilibrium with urea:\n\nCO(NH2)2 \u2192 [NH4]+[OCN]\u2212 \u2192 HNCO + NH3\nThis decomposition is at its worst when the urea solution is heated at low pressure, which happens when the solution is concentrated for prilling or granulation (see below). The reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours, and recombine when these condense to form urea again, which contaminates the process condensate.\n\nCorrosion: Ammonium carbamate solutions are highly corrosive to metallic construction materials \u2013 even to resistant forms of stainless steel \u2013 especially in the hottest parts of the synthesis plant such as the stripper. Historically corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuous injection of a small amount of oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Highly corrosion resistant materials have been introduced to reduce the need for passivation oxygen, such as specialized duplex stainless steels in the 1990s, and zirconium or zirconium-clad titanium tubing in the 2000s.\n\nFinishing: Urea can be produced in solid forms (prills, granules, pellets or crystals) or as solutions.\n\nSolid forms: For its main use as a fertilizer urea is mostly marketed in solid form, either as prills or granules. Prills are solidified droplets, whose production predates satisfactory urea granulation processes. Prills can be produced more cheaply than granules, but the limited size of prills (up to about 2.1 mm in diameter), their low crushing strength, and the caking or crushing of prills during bulk storage and handling make them inferior to granules. Granules are produced by acretion onto urea seed particles by spraying liquid urea in a succession of layers. Formaldehyde is added during the production of both prills and granules in order to increase crushing strength and suppress caking. Other shaping techniques such as pastillization (depositing uniform-sized liquid droplets onto a cooling conveyor belt) are also used.\n\nLiquid forms: Solutions of urea and ammonium nitrate in water (UAN) are commonly used as a liquid fertilizer. In admixture, the combined solubility of ammonium nitrate and urea is so much higher than that of either component alone that it gives a stable solution with a total nitrogen content (32%) approaching that of solid ammonium nitrate (33.5%), though not, of course, that of urea itself (46%). UAN allows use of ammonium nitrate without the explosion hazard. UAN accounts for 80% of the liquid fertilizers in the US.\n\nSee also: W\u00f6hler urea synthesis\nThiourea\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \nUrea in the Pesticide Properties DataBase (PPDB)\n\n\n pubchem:\nUrea appears as solid odorless white crystals or pellets.

        "text1": "Title: Biphenyl\nwikipedia: Biphenyl (also known as diphenyl, phenylbenzene, 1,1\u2032-biphenyl, lemonene or BP) is an organic compound that forms colorless  crystals.  Particularly in older literature, compounds containing the functional group consisting of biphenyl less one hydrogen (the site at which it is attached) may use the prefixes xenyl or diphenylyl.\nIt has a distinctively pleasant smell. Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a molecular formula (C6H5)2. It is notable as a starting material for the production of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which were once widely used as dielectric fluids and heat transfer agents.\nBiphenyl is also an intermediate for the production of a host of other organic compounds such as emulsifiers, optical brighteners, crop protection products, and plastics. Biphenyl is insoluble in water, but soluble in typical organic solvents. The biphenyl molecule consists of two connected phenyl rings.\n\nProperties and occurrence: Biphenyl is a solid at room temperature, with a melting point of 69.2 \u00b0C (156.6 \u00b0F). In the gas phase the molecule exists in two enantiomorphic twisted forms with an angle between the planes of the two rings of 44.4\u00b0. In the room-temperature solid, biphenyl is crystalline with space group P21/c, which does not allow for chiral crystals. Rather than there being a double-well potential entailing the two twisted conformations, the potential energy is minimized at zero twist.\nBiphenyl occurs naturally in coal tar, crude oil, and natural gas and can be isolated from these sources via distillation.  It is produced industrially as a byproduct of  the dealkylation of toluene to produce methane:\n\nC6H5CH3 + C6H6  \u2192  C6H5\u2212C6H5 + CH4\nThe other principal route is by the oxidative dehydrogenation of benzene:\n\n2 C6H6 + \u00bd O2  \u2192  C6H5\u2212C6H5 + H2O\nAnnually 40,000,000 kg are produced by these routes.\nIn the laboratory, biphenyl can also be synthesized by treating phenylmagnesium bromide with copper(II) salts.\nIt can also be prepared using diazonium salts. When aniline is treated with NaNO2+dilute HCl at 5\u00b0C, it yields benzene diazonium chloride. When this is further reacted with benzene, biphenyl is formed. This is known as the Gomberg\u2013Bachmann reaction.\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Ph\n          \n            \u2212\n          \n          \n            NH\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \u2192\n              \n                T\n                \n                  =273-278K\n                \n              \n              \n                \n                  \n                    NaNO\n                  \n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n                \n                  (aq), HCl\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          Ph\n          \n            \u2212\n          \n          \n            N\n            \n              2\n            \n            \n              +\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              \u2192\n              \n                \n                  Ph-H, \u0394\n                \n              \n            \n          \n          Ph\n          \n            \u2212\n          \n          Ph\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\ce {Ph-NH2->[{\\text{NaNO}}_{2}{\\text{(aq), HCl}}][T{\\text{=273-278K}}]Ph-N2+->[{\\text{Ph-H, \u0394}}]Ph-Ph}}}\n\nReactions and uses: Lacking functional groups, biphenyl is fairly non-reactive, which is the basis of its main application: in a eutectic mixture with diphenyl ether, as a heat transfer agent. This mixture is stable to 400 \u00b0C.\nBiphenyl does undergo sulfonation which, followed by base hydrolysis, produces p-hydroxybiphenyl and p,p\u2032-dihydroxybiphenyl, which are useful fungicides. In other substitution reactions, it undergoes halogenation.  Polychlorinated biphenyls were once popular pesticides.\n\nLi biphenyl radical: Lithium biphenyl contains the radical anion, which is highly reducing (-3.1 V vs Fc+/0).  Several solvates of alkali metal salts of biphenyl anion have been characterized by X-ray crystallography. These salts, usually prepared in situ, are versatile reducing agents. Lithium biphenyl offers some advantages relative to the related lithium naphthene.  Related to Li/biphenyl is the derivative with tert-butyl groups on the biphenyl.\n\nStereochemistry: Rotation about the single bond in biphenyl, and especially its ortho-substituted derivatives, is sterically hindered. For this reason, some substituted biphenyls show atropisomerism; that is, the individual C2-symmetric-isomers are optically stable. Some derivatives, as well as related molecules such as BINAP, find application as ligands in asymmetric synthesis. In the case of unsubstituted biphenyl, the equilibrium torsional angle is 44.4\u00b0 and the torsional barriers are quite small, 6.0 kJ/mol at 0\u00b0 and 6.5 kJ/mol at 90\u00b0. Adding ortho substituents greatly increases the barrier: in the case of the 2,2'-dimethyl derivative, the barrier is 17.4 kcal/mol (72.8 kJ/mol).\n\nBiphenyl compounds: Substituted biphenyls have many uses.  They are prepared by various coupling reactions including the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction and the Ullmann reaction. Polychlorinated biphenyls were once used as cooling and insulating fluids and polybrominated biphenyls are flame retardants. The biphenyl motif also appears in drugs such as diflunisal and telmisartan. The abbreviation E7 stands for a liquid crystal mixture consisting of several cyanobiphenyls with long aliphatic tails used commercially in liquid crystal displays (5CB, 7CB, 8OCB and 5CT). A variety of benzidine derivatives are used in dyes and polymers. Research into biphenyl liquid crystal candidates mainly focuses on molecules with highly polar heads (for example cyano or halide groups) and aliphatic tails. It is part of the active group in the antibiotic oritavancin.\n\nSafety and bioactivity: Biphenyl prevents the growth of molds and fungus, and is therefore used as a preservative (E230, in combination with E231, E232 and E233), particularly in the preservation of citrus fruits during transportation. It is no longer approved as a food additive in the European Union.\nBiphenyl is mildly toxic, but can be degraded biologically by conversion into nontoxic compounds. Some bacteria are able to hydroxylate biphenyl and its polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).\n\nSee also: Naphthalene, where the rings are fused\nTerphenyl, three ringed analog\nBithiophene\nPolypyrrole\nOMRE, experimental organic nuclear reactor that tested biphenyl as reactor coolant\n\nNotes: \n\nReferences: \"Isolation and Identification of Biphenyls from West Edmond Crude Oil\".

Biphenyl occurs naturally in coal tar, crude oil, and natural gas. Formerly used as a fungicide for citrus crops. It has a role as an antimicrobial food preservative and an antifungal agrochemical. It is a member of benzenes, an aromatic fungicide and a member of biphenyls.\nBiphenyl is used in organic syntheses, heat transfer fluids, dye carriers, food preservatives, as an intermediate for polychlorinated biphenyls, and as a fungistat in the packaging of citrus fruits. In workers, acute (short-term) exposure to high levels of biphenyl has been observed to cause eye and skin irritation and toxic effects on the liver, kidneys, and central and peripheral nervous systems. Kidney effects have been observed in chronically (long-term) exposed animals. EPA has classified biphenyl as a Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity.\nBiphenyl has been reported in Swertia japonica, Zea mays, and other organisms with data available.\nBiphenyl is found in alcoholic beverages. Fungistat, especially for citrus fruits. Biphenyl is used as food preservative and flavouring agent. Biphenyl is detected in bilberry, wine grape, carrot, peas, rum, potato, bell pepper, tomato, butter, milk, smoked fatty fish, cocoa, coffee, roast peanuts, olive, buckwheat and tamarind. Generally, the fruit packaging is impregnated with biphenyl, which evaporates into the air space surrounding the fruit.

        "text2": "Title: Diflunisal\nwikipedia: Diflunisal is a salicylic acid derivative with analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity. It was developed by Merck Sharp & Dohme in 1971, as MK647, after showing promise in a research project studying more potent chemical analogs of aspirin. It was first sold under the brand name Dolobid, marketed by Merck & Co., but generic versions are now widely available. It is classed as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is available in 250 mg and 500 mg tablets.\n\nMechanism of action: Like all NSAIDs, diflunisal acts by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, hormones which are involved in inflammation and pain. Diflunisal also has an antipyretic effect, but this is not a recommended use of the drug.\nIt has been found to inhibit p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), which are epigenetic regulators that control the levels of proteins that cause inflammation or are involved in cell growth.\nIt has been reported that diflunisal has some antibacterial activity  in vitro  against  Francisella tularensis  live vaccine strain (LVS).\n\nDuration of effect: Though diflunisal has an onset time of 1 hour, and maximum analgesia at 2 to 3 hours, the plasma levels of diflunisal will not be steady until repeated doses are taken. The long plasma half-life is a distinctive feature of diflunisal in comparison to similar drugs. To increase the rate at which the diflunisal plasma levels become steady, a loading dose is usually used. It is primarily used to treat symptoms of arthritis, and for acute pain following oral surgery, especially removal of wisdom teeth.\nEffectiveness of diflunisal is similar to other NSAIDs, but the duration of action is twelve hours or more. This means fewer doses per day are required for chronic administration. In acute use, it is popular in dentistry when a single dose after oral surgery can maintain analgesia until the patient is asleep that night.\n\nMedical uses: Pain, mild to moderate\nOsteoarthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nInjury to tendons\nInflammation\nATTR  amyloidosis\n\nAmyloidosis: Both diflunisal and several of its analogues have been shown to be inhibitors of transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis, a disease which currently has few treatment options.\nPhase I trials have shown the drug to be well tolerated, with a small Phase II trial (double-blind, placebo-controlled, 130 patients for 2 years) in 2013 showing a reduced rate of disease progression and preserved quality of life. However a significantly larger Phase III trial would be needed to prove the drugs effectiveness for treating this condition.\n\nSide effects: In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.\n\nGastrointestinal: The inhibition of prostaglandins has the effect of decreasing the protection given to the stomach from its own acid. Like all NSAIDS, this leads to an increased risk of stomach ulcers, and their complications, with long-term use. Elderly users of diflunisal are at greater risk for serious GI events.\n\nIncreased risk of GI events including bleeding, ulceration, and stomach or intestine perforation.\nAbdominal pain or cramps\nConstipation\nGas\nDiarrhea\nNausea and vomiting\nDyspepsia\n\nCardiovascular: Irregular heart beat\nPossible increased risk of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular thrombotic events, MI, and stroke\nRisks may increase with duration of use and for cardiovascular disease history\n\nEar, nose, throat, and eye: Ringing in the ears\nYellowing of eyes\n\nCentral nervous system: Drowsiness\nDizziness\nHeadache\nInsomnia\nFatigue\nSomnolence\nNervousness\n\nSkin: Swelling of the feet, ankles, lower legs, and hands\nYellowing of skin\nRash\nEcchymosis\n\nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to aspirin/NSAID-induced asthma (AERD) or urticaria\n3rd trimester pregnancy\nCoronary artery bypass surgery (peri-op pain)\n\nCautions: \n\nOverdose: Deaths that have occurred from diflunisal usually involved mixed drugs and or extremely high dosage. The oral LD50 is 500 mg/kg. Symptoms of overdose include coma, tachycardia, stupor, and vomiting. The lowest dose without the presence of other medicines which caused death was 15 grams. Mixed with other medicines, a death at 7.5 grams has also occurred.

It is 30 to 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine; its primary clinical utility is in pain management for cancer patients and those recovering from painful surgeries. Fentanyl is also used as a sedative. Depending on the method of delivery, fentanyl can be very fast acting and ingesting a relatively small quantity can cause overdose. Fentanyl works by activating \u03bc-opioid receptors. Fentanyl is sold under the brand names Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze, among others.\nPharmaceutical fentanyl's adverse effects are identical to those of other opioids and narcotics, including addiction, confusion, respiratory depression (which, if extensive and untreated, may lead to respiratory arrest), drowsiness, nausea, visual disturbances, dyskinesia, hallucinations, delirium, a subset of the latter known as \"narcotic delirium\", narcotic ileus, muscle rigidity, constipation, loss of consciousness, hypotension, coma, and death. Alcohol and other drugs (e.g., cocaine and heroin) can synergistically exacerbate fentanyl's side effects. Naloxone (also known as Narcan) can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, but because fentanyl is so potent, multiple doses might be necessary.\nFentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1959 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1968. In 2015, 1,600 kilograms (3,500 pounds) were used in healthcare globally. As of 2017, fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine; in 2019, it was the 278th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than a million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\nFentanyl continues to fuel an epidemic of synthetic opioid drug overdose deaths in the United States. From 2011 to 2021, prescription opioid deaths per year remained stable, while synthetic opioid deaths per year increased from 2,600 overdoses to 70,601. Since 2018, fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible for most drug overdose deaths in the United States, causing over 71,238 deaths in 2021. Fentanyl constitutes the majority of all drug overdose deaths in the United States since it overtook heroin in 2018. The United States National Forensic Laboratory estimates fentanyl reports by federal, state, and local forensic laboratories increased from 4,697 reports in 2014 to 117,045 reports in 2020. Fentanyl is often mixed, cut, or ingested alongside other drugs, including cocaine and heroin. Fentanyl has been reported in pill form, including pills mimicking pharmaceutical drugs such as oxycodone. Mixing with other drugs or disguising as a pharmaceutical makes it difficult to determine the correct treatment in the case of an overdose, resulting in more deaths. In an attempt to reduce the number of overdoses from taking other drugs mixed with fentanyl, drug testing kits, strips, and labs are available. Fentanyl's ease of manufacture and high potency makes it easier to produce and smuggle, resulting in fentanyl replacing other abused narcotics and becoming more widely used.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nAnesthesia: Intravenous fentanyl is often used for anesthesia and as an analgesic. To induce anesthesia, it is given with a sedative-hypnotic, like propofol or thiopental, and a euphoriant. To maintain anesthesia, inhaled anesthetics and additional fentanyl may be used. These are often given in 15\u201330 minute intervals throughout procedures such as endoscopy and surgeries and in emergency rooms.\nFor pain relief after surgery, use can decrease the amount of inhalational anesthetic needed for emergence from anesthesia. Balancing this medication and titrating the drug based on expected stimuli and the person's responses can result in stable blood pressure and heart rate throughout a procedure and a faster emergence from anesthesia with minimal pain.\n\nRegional anesthesia: Fentanyl is the most commonly used intrathecal opioid because its lipophilic profile allows a quick onset of action (5\u201310 min) and intermediate duration of action (60\u2013120 min). Spinal administration of hyperbaric bupivacaine with fentanyl may be the optimal combination. The almost immediate onset of fentanyl reduces visceral discomfort and even nausea during the procedure.\n\nObstetrics: Fentanyl is sometimes given intrathecally as part of spinal anesthesia or epidurally for epidural anaesthesia and analgesia. Because of fentanyl's high lipid solubility, its effects are more localized than morphine, and some clinicians prefer to use morphine to get a wider spread of analgesia. It is widely used in obstetrical anesthesia because of its short time to action peak (about 5 minutes), the rapid termination of its effect after a single dose, and the occurrence of relative cardiovascular stability. In obstetrics, the dose must be closely regulated to prevent large amounts of transfer from mother to fetus. At high doses, the drug may act on the fetus to cause postnatal Stimulant. For this reason, shorter-acting agents such as alfentanyl or remifentanil may be more suitable in the context of inducing general anaesthesia.\n\nPain management: The bioavailability of intranasal fentanyl is about 70\u201390% but with some imprecision due to clotted nostrils, pharyngeal swallow, and incorrect administration. For both emergency and palliative use, intranasal fentanyl is available in doses of 50, 100, 200, 400(PecFent) \u03bcg. In emergency medicine, safe administration of intranasal fentanyl with a low rate of side effects and a promising pain-reducing effect was demonstrated in a prospective observational study in about 900 out-of-hospital patients.\nIn children, intranasal fentanyl is useful for the treatment of moderate and severe pain and is well tolerated. Furthermore, a 2017 study suggested the efficacy of fentanyl lozenges in children as young as five, weighing as little as 13 kg. Lozenges are more inclined to be used as the child is in control of sufficient dosage, in contrast to buccal tablets.\n\nChronic pain: It is also used in the management of chronic pain. Often, transdermal patches are used. The patches work by slowly releasing fentanyl through the skin into the bloodstream over 48 to 72 hours, allowing for long-lasting pain management. Dosage is based on the size of the patch, since, in general, the transdermal absorption rate is constant at a constant skin temperature. Each patch should be changed every 72 hours. Rate of absorption is dependent on a number of factors. Body temperature, skin type, amount of body fat, and placement of the patch can have major effects. The different delivery systems used by different makers will also affect individual rates of absorption, and route of administration. Under normal circumstances, the patch will reach its full effect within 12 to 24 hours; thus, fentanyl patches are often prescribed with a fast-acting opioid (such as morphine or oxycodone) to handle breakthrough pain. It is unclear if fentanyl gives long-term pain relief to people with neuropathic pain.\n\nBreakthrough pain: Sublingual fentanyl dissolves quickly and is absorbed through the sublingual mucosa to provide rapid analgesia. Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic compound, which is well absorbed sublingually and generally well tolerated. Such forms are particularly useful for breakthrough cancer pain episodes, which are often rapid in onset, short in duration, and severe in intensity.\n\nPalliative care: In palliative care, transdermal fentanyl patches have a definitive, but limited role for:\n\npeople already stabilized on other opioids who have persistent swallowing problems and cannot tolerate other parenteral routes such as subcutaneous administration.\npeople with moderate to severe kidney failure.\ntroublesome side effects of oral morphine, hydromorphone, or oxycodone.\nWhen using the transdermal patch, patients must be careful to minimize or avoid external heat sources (direct sunlight, heating pads, etc.), which can trigger the release and absorption of too much medication and cause potentially deadly complications.\n\nCombat medicine: USAF Pararescue combat medics in Afghanistan used fentanyl lozenges in the form of lollipops on combat casualties from IED blasts and other trauma. The stick is taped to a finger and the lozenge put in the cheek of the person. When enough fentanyl has been absorbed, the (sedated) person generally lets the lollipop fall from the mouth, indicating sufficient analgesia and somewhat reducing the likelihood of overdose and associated risks.\n\nBreathing difficulties: Fentanyl is used to help relieve shortness of breath (dyspnea) when patients cannot tolerate morphine, or whose breathlessness is refractory to morphine. Fentanyl is useful for such treatment in palliative care settings where pain and shortness of breath are severe and need to be treated with strong opioids. Nebulized fentanyl citrate is used to relieve end-of-life dyspnea in hospice settings.\n\nOther: Some routes of administration such as nasal sprays and inhalers generally result in a faster onset of high blood levels, which can provide more immediate analgesia but also more severe side effects, especially in overdose. The much higher cost of some of these appliances may not be justified by marginal benefit compared with buccal or oral options. Intranasal fentanyl appears to be equally effective as IV morphine and superior to intramuscular morphine for the management of acute hospital pain.\nA fentanyl patient-controlled transdermal system (PCTS) is under development, which aims to allow patients to control the administration of fentanyl through the skin to treat postoperative pain. The technology consists of a \"preprogrammed, self-contained drug-delivery system\" that uses electrotransport technology to administer on-demand doses of 40 \u03bcg of fentanyl hydrochloride over ten minutes. In a 2004 experiment including 189 patients with moderate to severe postoperative pain up to 24 hours after major surgery, 25% of patients withdrew due to inadequate analgesia. However, the PCTS method proved superior to the placebo, showing lower mean VAS pain scores and having no significant respiratory depression effects.\n\nAdverse effects: Fentanyl's most common side effects, which affect more than 10% of people, include nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, somnolence, confusion, and asthenia (weakness). Less frequently, in 3\u201310% of people, fentanyl can cause abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, anorexia and weight loss, dizziness, nervousness, anxiety, depression, flu-like symptoms, dyspepsia (indigestion), shortness of breath, hypoventilation, apnoea, and urinary retention. Fentanyl use has also been associated with aphasia. Despite being a more potent analgesic, fentanyl tends to induce less nausea, as well as less histamine-mediated itching, than morphine. In rare cases, serotonin syndrome is associated with fentanyl use. Existing studies advise medical practitioners to exercise caution when combining selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs with fentanyl.\nThe duration of action of fentanyl has sometimes been underestimated, leading to harm in a medical context. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began investigating several respiratory deaths, but doctors in the United Kingdom were not warned of the risks with fentanyl until September 2008. The FDA reported in April 2012 that twelve young children had died and twelve more had become seriously ill from separate accidental exposures to fentanyl skin patches.\n\nRespiratory depression: The most dangerous adverse effect of fentanyl is respiratory depression, that is, decreased sensitivity to carbon dioxide leading to reduced rate of breathing, which can cause anoxic brain injury or death. This risk is decreased when the airway is secured with an endotracheal tube (as during anesthesia). This risk is higher in specific groups, like those with obstructive sleep apnea.\nOther factors that increase the risk of respiratory depression are:\n\nHigh fentanyl doses\nSimultaneous use of methadone\nSleep\nOlder age\nSimultaneous use of CNS depressants like benzodiazepines (i.e. alprazolam, diazepam, clonazepam), barbiturates, alcohol, and inhaled anesthetics\nHyperventilation\nDecreased CO2 levels in the serum\nRespiratory acidosis\nDecreased fentanyl clearance from the body\nDecreased blood flow to the liver\nRenal insufficiency\nSustained release fentanyl preparations, such as patches, may also produce unexpected delayed respiratory depression. The precise reason for sudden respiratory depression is unclear, but there are several hypotheses:\n\nSaturation of the body fat compartment in people with rapid and profound body fat loss (people with cancer, cardiac or infection-induced cachexia can lose 80% of their body fat).\nEarly carbon dioxide retention causes cutaneous vasodilation (releasing more fentanyl), together with acidosis, which reduces the protein binding of fentanyl, releasing yet more fentanyl.\nReduced sedation, losing a useful early warning sign of opioid toxicity and resulting in levels closer to respiratory-depressant levels.\nAnother related complication of fentanyl overdoses includes the so-called wooden chest syndrome, which quickly induces complete respiratory failure by paralyzing the thoracic muscles, explained in more detail in the Muscle rigidity section below.\n\nHeart and blood vessels: Bradycardia: Fentanyl decreases the heart rate by increasing vagal nerve tone in the brainstem, which increases the parasympathetic drive.\nVasodilation: It also vasodilates arterial and venous blood vessels through a central mechanism, by primarily slowing down vasomotor centers in the brainstem. To a lesser extent, it does this by directly affecting blood vessels. This is much more profound in patients who have an already increased sympathetic drive, like patients who have high blood pressure or congestive heart failure. It does not affect the contractility of the heart when regular doses are administered.\n\nMuscle rigidity: If high boluses of fentanyl are administered quickly, muscle rigidity of the vocal cords can make bag-mask ventilation very difficult. The exact mechanism of this effect is unknown, but it can be prevented and treated using neuromuscular blockers.\n\nWooden chest syndrome: A prominent idiosyncratic adverse effect of fentanyl also includes a sudden onset of rigidity of the abdominal muscles and the diaphragm, which induces respiratory failure; this is seen with high doses and is known as wooden chest syndrome. The syndrome is believed to be the main cause of death as a result of fentanyl overdoses.\nWooden chest syndrome is reversed by naloxone and is believed to be caused by a release of noradrenaline, which activates \u03b1-adrenergic receptors and also possibly via activation of cholinergic receptors.\nWooden chest syndrome is unique to the most powerful opioids\u2014which today comprise fentanyl and its analogs\u2014while other less-powerful opioids like heroin produce mild rigidity of the respiratory muscles to a much lesser degree.\n\n\"Fentanyl fold\" posture: There are many reports of fentanyl users adopting a \"folded\" posture. \nDaniel Ciccarone of UCSF said what he calls the \u201cnod\u201d is a common side effect of opioid use, and later notes that \"nods have always happened to varying degrees with other opioids, particularly heroin. The nods with fentanyl, however, seem to be more extreme. And it's often a sign that a person has taken too strong a dose\". \nHe also said \"the fentanyl fold falls into the umbrella of a severe spinal deformity that can cause functional disability and can drive mental anguish\" which is a factor given the socioeconomic status and more fragile mental health of drug users typically when compared to non-users.\n\nOverdose: Fentanyl poses an exceptionally high overdose risk in humans since the amount required to cause toxicity is unpredictable. In its pharmaceutical form, most overdose deaths attributed solely to fentanyl occur at serum concentrations at a mean of 0.025 \u03bcg/mL, with a range 0.005\u20130.027 \u03bcg/mL. In contexts of poly-substance use, blood fentanyl concentrations of approximately 7 ng/mL or greater have been associated with fatalities. Over 85% of overdoses involved at least one other drug, and there was no clear correlation showing at which level the mixtures were fatal. The dosages of fatal mixtures varied by over three magnitudes in some cases. This extremely unpredictable volatility with other drugs makes it especially difficult to avoid fatalities.\nNaloxone (sold under the brand name Narcan) can completely or partially reverse an opioid overdose. In July 2014, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the UK issued a warning about the potential for life-threatening harm from accidental exposure to transdermal fentanyl patches, particularly in children, and advised that they should be folded, with the adhesive side in, before being discarded. The patches should be kept away from children, who are most at risk from fentanyl overdose. In the US, fentanyl and fentanyl analogs caused over 29,000 deaths in 2017, a large increase over the previous four years.\n\nSome increases in fentanyl deaths do not involve prescription fentanyl but are related to illicitly made fentanyl that is being mixed with or sold as heroin. Death from fentanyl overdose continues to be a public health issue of national concern in Canada since September 2015. In 2016, deaths from fentanyl overdoses in the province of British Columbia averaged two persons per day. In 2017 the death rate increased by more than 100% with 368 overdose-related deaths in British Columbia between January and April 2017.\n\nFentanyl has started to make its way into heroin as well as illicitly manufactured opioids and benzodiazepines. Fentanyl contamination in cocaine, methamphetamine, ketamine, MDMA, and other drugs is common. A kilogram of heroin laced with fentanyl may sell for more than US$100,000, but the fentanyl itself may be produced far more cheaply, for about US$6,000 per kilogram. While Mexico and China are the primary source countries for fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances trafficked directly into the United States, India is emerging as a source for finished fentanyl powder and fentanyl precursor chemicals. The United Kingdom illicit drug market is no longer reliant on China, as domestic fentanyl production is replacing imports.\nThe intravenous dose causing 50% of opioid-naive experimental subjects to die (LD50) is \"3 mg/kg in rats, 1 mg/kg in cats, 14 mg/kg in dogs, and 0.03 mg/kg in monkeys.\" The LD50 in mice has been given as 6.9 mg/kg by intravenous administration, 17.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 27.8 mg/kg by oral administration. The LD50 in humans is unknown.\nIn 2023, overdose deaths in the U.S. and Canada again reached record numbers. While overdoes involving fentanyl in the United States have decreased in 2024, the overall percentage of overdoes involving fentanyl has remained stable between 70% and 80% from 2021-2024. According to a 2023 report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the increased numbers of deaths are not related to an increased number of users but to the lethal effects of fentanyl itself. Fentanyl would require a special status as it is considerably more toxic than other widely abused opioids and opiates. Overdose deaths in pediatric cases are also concerning. In a report published in JAMA Pediatrics, 37.5% of all fatal pediatric cases between 1999 and 2021 were related to fentanyl; most of the deaths were among adolescents (89.6%) and children aged 0 to 4 years (6.6%). According to the UNODC, \"the opioid crisis in North America is unabated, fueled by an unprecedented number of overdose deaths.\"\n\nFalse reports by police of poisonings through secondary exposure: In the late 2010s, some media outlets began to report stories of police officers being hospitalized after touching powdered fentanyl, or after brushing it from their clothing. Topical (or transdermal; via the skin) and inhalative exposure to fentanyl is extremely unlikely to cause intoxication or overdose (except in cases of prolonged exposure with very large quantities of fentanyl), and first responders such as paramedics and police officers are at minimal risk of fentanyl poisoning through accidental contact with intact skin. A 2020 article from the Journal of Medical Toxicology stated that \"the consensus of the scientific community remains that illness from unintentional exposures is extremely unlikely, because opioids are not efficiently absorbed through the skin and are unlikely to be carried in the air.\" The American College of Medical Toxicology and the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology issued a joint report in 2017 asserting the risk of fentanyl overdose via incidental transdermal exposure is very low, and it would take 200\u2009 minutes of breathing fentanyl at the highest airborne concentrations to yield a therapeutic dose, but not a potentially fatal one. The effects being reported in these cases, including rapid heartbeat, hyperventilation and chills, were not symptoms of a fentanyl overdose, and were more commonly associated with a panic attack.\nA 2021 paper expressed concern that these physical fears over fentanyl may inhibit effective emergency response to overdoses by causing responding officers to spend additional time on unnecessary precautions and that the media coverage could also perpetuate a wider social stigma that people who use drugs are dangerous to be around. A 2020 survey of first responders in New York found that 80% believed \u201cbriefly touching fentanyl could be deadly.\u201d\nMany experts in toxicology are skeptical of police truly overdosing through mere touch. \"This has never happened,\" said Dr. Ryan Marino, an emergency and addiction medicine physician at Case Western Reserve University. \"There has never been an overdose through skin contact or accidentally inhaling fentanyl.\"\n\nPrevention: Public health advisories to prevent fentanyl misuse and fatal overdose have been issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). An initial HAN Advisory, also known as a Health Alert Network Advisory (\"provides vital, time-sensitive information for a specific incident or situation; warrants immediate action or attention by health officials, laboratorians, clinicians, and members of the public; and conveys the highest level of importance\") was issued during October 2015. A subsequent HAN Alert was issued in July 2018, warning of rising numbers of deaths due to fentanyl abuse and mixing with non-opioids. A December 2020 HAN Advisory warned of:\n\nsubstantial increases in drug overdose deaths across the United States, primarily driven by rapid increases in overdose deaths involving ... illicitly manufactured fentanyl; a concerning acceleration of the increase in drug overdose deaths, with the largest increase recorded from March 2020 to May 2020, coinciding with the implementation of widespread mitigation measures for the COVID-19 pandemic; significant increases in overdose deaths involving methamphetamine.\n81,230 drug overdose deaths occurred during the 12 months from May 2019 to May 2020, the largest number of drug overdoses for a 12-month interval ever recorded for the U.S. The CDC recommended the following four actions to counter this rise:\n\nLocal need to expand the distribution and use of naloxone and overdose prevention education,\nExpand awareness, access, and availability of treatment for substance use disorders,\nIntervene early with individuals at the highest risk for overdose, and\nimprove detection of overdose outbreaks to facilitate more effective response.\nAnother initiative is a social media campaign from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) called \"One Pill Can Kill\". This social media campaign's goal is to spread awareness of the prevalence of counterfeit pills that are being sold in America that is leading to the large overdose epidemic in America. This campaign also shows the difference between counterfeit pills and real pills.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nClassification: Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid in the phenylpiperidine family, which includes sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and carfentanil. Some fentanyl analogues, such as carfentanil, are up to 10,000 times stronger than morphine.\n\nStructure-activity: The structures of opioids share many similarities. Whereas opioids like codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, and hydromorphone are synthesized by simple modifications of morphine, fentanyl, and its relatives are synthesized by modifications of meperidine. Meperidine is a fully synthetic opioid, and other members of the phenylpiperidine family like alfentanil and sufentanil are complex versions of this structure.\nLike other opioids, fentanyl is a weak base that is highly lipid-soluble, protein-bound, and protonated at physiological pH. All of these factors allow it to rapidly cross cellular membranes, contributing to its quick effect in the body and the central nervous system.\n\nFentanyl analogs: Fentanyl analogs are types of fentanyl with various chemical modifications on any number of positions of the molecule, but still maintain, or even exceed, its pharmacological effects. Many fentanyl analogs are termed \"designer drugs\" because they are synthesized solely to be used illicitly. Carfentanil, a fentanyl analog, has an additional carboxylic acid group attached to the 4 position. Carfentanil is 20\u201330 times as potent as fentanyl and is common in the illicit drug chain. The drug is commonly used to tranquilize elephants and other large animals.\n\nMechanism of action: Fentanyl, like other opioids, acts on opioid receptors. These receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, which contain seven transmembrane portions, intracellular loops, extracellular loops, intracellular C-terminus, and extracellular N-terminus. The extracellular N-terminus is important in differentiating different types of binding substrates. When fentanyl binds, downstream signaling leads to inhibitory effects, such as decreased cAMP production, decreased calcium ion influx, and increased potassium efflux. This inhibits the ascending pathways in the central nervous system to increase pain threshold by changing the perception of pain; this is mediated by decreasing propagation of nociceptive signals, resulting in analgesic effects.\nAs a \u03bc-receptor agonist, fentanyl binds 50 to 100 times more potently than morphine. It can also bind to the delta and kappa opioid receptors but with a lower affinity. It has high lipid solubility, allowing it to more easily penetrate the central nervous system. It attenuates \"second pain\" with primary effects on slow-conducting, unmyelinated C-fibers and is less effective on neuropathic pain and \"first pain\" signals through small, myelinated A-fibers.\nFentanyl can produce the following clinical effects strongly, through \u03bc-receptor agonism:\n\nSupraspinal analgesia (\u03bc1)\nRespiratory depression (\u03bc2)\nPhysical dependence\nMuscle rigidity\nIt also produces sedation and spinal analgesia through \u039a-receptor agonism.\n\nTherapeutic effects: Pain relief: Primarily, fentanyl provides the relief of pain by acting on the brain and spinal \u03bc-receptors.\nSedation: Fentanyl produces sleep and drowsiness, as the dosage is increased, and can produce the \u03b4-waves often seen in natural sleep on electroencephalogram.\nSuppression of the cough reflex: Fentanyl can decrease the struggle against an endotracheal tube and excessive coughing by decreasing the cough reflex, becoming useful when intubating people who are awake and have compromised airways. After receiving a bolus dose of fentanyl, people can also experience paradoxical coughing, which is a phenomenon that is not well understood.\n\nDetection in biological fluids: Fentanyl may be measured in blood or urine to monitor for abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Commercially available immunoassays are often used as initial screening tests, but chromatographic techniques are generally used for confirmation and quantitation. The Marquis Color test may also be used to detect the presence of fentanyl. Using formaldehyde and sulfuric acid, the solution will turn purple when introduced to opium drugs. Blood or plasma fentanyl concentrations are expected to be in a range of 0.3\u20133.0 \u03bcg/L in persons using the medication therapeutically, 1\u201310 \u03bcg/L in intoxicated people, and 3\u2013300 \u03bcg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Paper spray-mass spectrometry (PS-MS) may be useful for initial testing of samples.\n\nDetection for harm reduction purposes: Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues can be qualitatively detected in drug samples using commercially available fentanyl testing strips or spot reagents. Following the principles of harm reduction, this test is to be used directly on drug samples as opposed to urine. To prepare a sample for testing, approximately 10 mg of the drug, about the size of hair on Abraham Lincoln's head on a penny, should be diluted into 1 teaspoon, or 5 mL, of water. Research in Dr. Lieberman's lab at the University of Notre Dame has reported false positive results on BTNX fentanyl testing strips with methamphetamine, MDMA, and diphenhydramine. The sensitivity and specificity of fentanyl test strips vary depending on the concentration of fentanyl tested, particularly from 10 to 250 ng/mL.\n\nSynthesis: Fentanyl is a 4-anilopiperidine class synthetic opioid. The synthesis of Fentanyl is accomplished by one of four main methods as reported in the scientific literature: the Janssen, Siegfried, Gupta, or Suh method.\n\nJanssen: The original synthesis as patented in 1964 by Paul Janssen involves the synthesis of benzylfentanyl from N-Benzyl-4-Piperidone. The resulting benzylfentanyl is used as feedstock to norfentanyl. It is norfentanyl that forms fentanyl upon reaction with phenethyl chloride.\n\nSiegfried: The Siegfried method involves the initial synthesis of N-phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP). This intermediate is reductively aminated to 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (4-ANPP). Fentanyl is produced following the reaction of 4-ANPP with an acyl chloride. The Siegfried method has been used in the early 2000s to manufacture fentanyl in both domestic and foreign clandestine laboratories.\n\nGupta: The Gupta (or 'one-pot') method starts from 4-Piperidone and skips the direct use of 4-ANPP/NPP; rather the compounds are formed only as impurities or temporary intermediates. For the first half of 2021, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration found the Gupta method was the predominant synthesis route in their samples of seized fentanyl. In 2022, Braga and coworkers described a synthesis of fentanyl involving continuous flow that uses reagents similar to the ones described for the Gupta procedure.\n\nSuh: The Suh (or 'total synthesis') method skips the direct use of piperidine precursors in favor of creating the ring system in-situ.\n\nHistory: Fentanyl was first synthesized in Belgium by Paul Janssen under the label of his relatively newly formed Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1959. It was developed by screening chemicals similar to pethidine (meperidine) for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (the salt formed by combining fentanyl and citric acid in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio). Fentanyl citrate entered medical use as a general anaesthetic in 1968, manufactured by McNeil Laboratories under the brand name Sublimaze.\nIn the mid-1990s, Janssen Pharmaceutica developed and introduced into clinical trials the Duragesic patch, which is a formulation of an inert alcohol gel infused with select fentanyl doses, which are worn to provide constant administration of the opioid over 48 to 72 hours. After a set of successful clinical trials, Duragesic fentanyl patches were introduced into medical practice.\nFollowing the patch, a flavored lollipop of fentanyl citrate mixed with inert fillers was introduced in 1998 under the brand name Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of fentanyl for use with chronic breakthrough pain.\nIn 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Onsolis (fentanyl buccal soluble film), a fentanyl drug in a new dosage form for cancer pain management in opioid-tolerant subjects. It uses a medication delivery technology called BEMA (BioErodible MucoAdhesive), a small dissolvable polymer film containing various fentanyl doses applied to the inner lining of the cheek.\nFentanyl has a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number (ACSCN) of 9801. Its annual aggregate manufacturing quota has significantly reduced in recent years from 2,300,000 kg in 2015 and 2016 to only 731,452 kg in 2021, a nearly 68.2% decrease.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nLegal status: In the UK, fentanyl is classified as a controlled Class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.\nIn the Netherlands, fentanyl is a List I substance of the Opium Law.\nIn the U.S., fentanyl is a Schedule II controlled substance per the Controlled Substance Act. Distributors of Abstral are required to implement an FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program. In order to curb misuse, many health insurers have begun to require precertification and/or quantity limits for Actiq prescriptions.\nIn Canada, fentanyl is considered a schedule I drug as listed in Canada's Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.\nEstonia is known to have been home to the world's longest documented fentanyl epidemic, especially following the Taliban ban on opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan.\nA 2018 report by The Guardian indicated that many major drug suppliers on the dark web have voluntarily banned the trafficking of fentanyl.\nThe fentanyl epidemic has erupted in a highly acrimonious dispute between the U.S. and Mexican governments. While U.S. officials blame the flood of fentanyl crossing the border primarily on Mexican crime groups, then-President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador insisted that the main source of this synthetic drug is Asia. He stated that the crisis of a lack of family values in the United States drives people to use the drug.\n\nRecreational use: Illicit use of pharmaceutical fentanyl and its analogues first appeared in the mid-1970s in the medical community and continues in the present. More than 12 different analogues of fentanyl, all unapproved and clandestinely produced, have been identified in the U.S. drug traffic. In February 2018, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration indicated that illicit fentanyl analogs have no medically valid use, and thus applied a \"Schedule I\" classification to them.\nFentanyl analogues may be hundreds of times more potent than heroin. Fentanyl is used orally, smoked, snorted, or injected. Fentanyl is sometimes sold as heroin or oxycodone, which can lead to overdose. Many fentanyl overdoses are initially classified as heroin overdoses. Recreational use is not particularly widespread in the EU except for Tallinn, Estonia, where it has largely replaced heroin. Estonia has the highest rate of 3-methylfentanyl overdose deaths in the EU, due to its high rate of recreational use.\nFentanyl is sometimes sold on the black market in the form of transdermal fentanyl patches such as Duragesic, diverted from legitimate medical supplies. The gel from inside the patches is sometimes ingested or injected.\nAnother form of fentanyl that has appeared on the streets is the Actiq lollipop formulation. The pharmacy retail price ranges from US$15 to US$50 per unit based on the strength of the lozenge, with the black market cost ranging from US$5 to US$25, depending on the dose. The attorneys general of Connecticut and Pennsylvania have launched investigations into its diversion from the legitimate pharmaceutical market, including Cephalon's \"sales and promotional practices for Provigil, Actiq and Gabitril.\"\nNon-medical use of fentanyl by individuals without opioid tolerance can be very dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances are at high risk for overdoses. Like all opioids, the effects of fentanyl can be reversed with naloxone, or other opiate antagonists. Naloxone is increasingly available to the public. Long-acting or sustained-release opioids may require repeat dosage. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.\nSome heroin dealers mix fentanyl powder with heroin to increase potency or compensate for low-quality heroin. In 2006, illegally manufactured, non-pharmaceutical fentanyl often mixed with cocaine or heroin caused an outbreak of overdose deaths in the United States and Canada, heavily concentrated in the cities of Dayton, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Detroit, Michigan; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nEnforcement: Several large quantities of illicitly produced fentanyl have been seized by U.S. law enforcement agencies. In November 2016, the DEA uncovered an operation making counterfeit oxycodone and Xanax from a home in Cottonwood Heights, Utah. They found about 70,000 pills in the appearance of oxycodone and more than 25,000 in the appearance of Xanax. The DEA reported that millions of pills could have been distributed from this location over the course of time. The accused owned a tablet press and ordered fentanyl in powder form from China. A seizure of a record amount of fentanyl occurred on 2 February 2019, by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in Nogales, Arizona. The 254 pounds (115 kg) of fentanyl, which was estimated to be worth US$3.5M, was concealed in a compartment under a false floor of a truck transporting cucumbers. The \"China White\" form of fentanyl refers to any of a number of clandestinely produced analogues, especially \u03b1-methylfentanyl (AMF). One US Department of Justice publication lists \"China White\" as a synonym for a number of fentanyl analogues, including 3-methylfentanyl and \u03b1-methylfentanyl, which today are classified as Schedule I drugs in the United States. Part of the motivation for AMF is that, despite the extra difficulty from a synthetic standpoint, the resultant drug is more resistant to metabolic degradation. This results in a drug with an increased duration.\nIn June 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory to emergency departments alerting to 14 overdose deaths among intravenous drug users in Rhode Island associated with acetylfentanyl, a synthetic opioid analog of fentanyl that has never been licensed for medical use. In a separate study conducted by the CDC, 82% of fentanyl overdose deaths involved illegally manufactured fentanyl, while only 4% were suspected to originate from a prescription.\nBeginning in 2015, Canada has seen several fentanyl overdoses. Authorities suspected that the drug was being imported from Asia to the western coast by organized crime groups in powder form and being pressed into pseudo-OxyContin tablets. Traces of the drug have also been found in other recreational drugs, including cocaine, MDMA, and heroin. The drug has been implicated in the deaths of people from all walks of life\u2014from homeless individuals to professionals\u2014including teens and young parents. Because of the rising deaths across the country, especially in British Columbia where 1,716 deaths were reported in 2020 and 1,782 from January to October 2021, Health Canada is putting a rush on a review of the prescription-only status of naloxone in an effort to combat overdoses of the drug. In 2018, Global News reported allegations that diplomatic tensions between Canada and China hindered cooperation to seize imports, with Beijing being accused of inaction.\nFentanyl has been discovered for sale in illicit markets in Australia in 2017 and in New Zealand in 2018. In response, New Zealand experts called for wider availability of naloxone.\nIn May 2019, China regulated the entire class of fentanyl-type drugs and two fentanyl precursors. Nevertheless, it remains the principal origin of fentanyl in the United States: Mexican cartels source fentanyl precursors from Chinese suppliers such as Yuancheng Group, which are finished in Mexico and smuggled to the United States. Following the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, China halted cooperation with the United States on combatting drug trafficking.\nIndia has also emerged as a source of fentanyl and fentanyl precursors, where Mexican cartels have already developed networks for the import of synthetic drugs. It is possible that fentanyl and precursor production may disperse to other countries, such as Nigeria, South Africa, Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Netherlands.\nIn 2020, the Myanmar military and police confiscated 990 gallons of \"methyl fentanyl\" [sic], as well as precursors for the illicit synthesis of the drug. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Shan State of Myanmar has been identified as a major source for fentanyl derivatives. In 2021, the agency reported a further drop in opium poppy cultivation in Burma, as the region's synthetic drug market continues to expand and diversify.\nIn 2023, a California police union director was charged with importing synthetic opioids, including fentanyl and tapentadol disguised as chocolate. U.S. law enforcement had been slow in their response to the fentanyl crisis, according to the Washington Post. The response by the federal government to the fentanyl crisis had also faltered, according to the press release. Overdose deaths by fentanyl and other illegally imported opioids were surging since 2019 and are presently a major cause of death in all U.S. states.\nAccording to the national archives and the DEA, direct fentanyl shipments from China have stopped since 2022. The majority of illicit fentanyl and analogues now entering the U.S. from Mexico are final products in form of \"tablets\" and adulterated heroin from previously synthesized fentanyl. From the sophistication of full fentanyl synthesis and acute toxicity in laboratory environments, 'clandestine' labs in Mexico relate to making an illicit dosage form from available fentanyl rather than the synthesis itself. Based on further research by investigators, fentanyl and analogues are likely synthesized in labs that have the appearance of a legal entity, or are diverted from pharmaceutical laboratories.\nRecent investigations and convictions of members of the Sinaloa drug cartel by federal agencies made a clear connection between illegal arms trafficking from the U.S. to Mexico and the smuggling of fentanyl into the U.S. Mexico had repeatedly made official complaints since illegal guns are easily purchased for example in Arizona and as far north as Wisconsin and even Alaska, according to U.S. intelligence sources, and transported onto Mexican territory through a chain of American brokers and couriers often financed by those drug cartels that also engage in money laundering. Therefore, the lack of arms controls in the U.S. has directly contributed to the U.S. opioid overdose crisis.\n\nBrand names: Brand names include Sublimaze, Actiq, Durogesic, Duragesic, Fentora, Matrifen, Haldid, Onsolis, Instanyl, Abstral, Lazanda and others.\n\nEconomics: In the United States, the 800 mcg tablet was 6.75 times more expensive as of 2020 than the lozenge. As of 2023, the average cost for an injectable fentanyl solution (50 mcg/mL) is around US$17 for a supply of 20 milliliters, depending on the pharmacy. In a 2020 report by the Australian Institute of Criminology, a 100-microgram transdermal patch was valued from between AU$75 and AU$450 on illicit markets. Furthermore, in another 2020 study, the average price per gram of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl on various cryptomarkets was US$1,470.40 for offerings of less than five grams; the average for offers over five grams was US$139.50. In addition, on DreamMarket furanfentanyl (Fu-F), the most common analog on said market, the average price per gram was US$243.10 for retail listings and US$26.50 per gram for wholesale listings.\n\nStorage and disposal: The fentanyl patch is one of a few medications that may be especially harmful, and in some cases fatal, with just one dose, if misused by a child. Experts have advised that any unused fentanyl patches be kept in a secure location out of children's sight and reach, such as a locked cabinet.\nIn British Columbia, Canada, where there are environmental concerns about toilet flushing or garbage disposal, pharmacists recommend that unused patches be sealed in a child-proof container that is then returned to a pharmacy. In the United States where patches cannot always be returned through a medication take-back program, flushing is recommended for fentanyl patches, because it is the fastest and surest way to remove them from the home to prevent ingestion by children, pets or others not intended to use them.\n\nNotable deaths: On 25 September 2003, American professional wrestler Anthony Durante, also known as \"Pitbull #2\", died from a fentanyl-induced overdose.\nOn 24 May 2009, Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl.\nOn 24 May 2010, Slipknot bassist Paul Gray died from an overdose of morphine and fentanyl.\nOn 21 April 2016, musician Prince died and medical examiners concluded he had accidentally overdosed on fentanyl. Fentanyl was among many substances identified in counterfeit pills recovered from his home, including some that were mislabeled as Watson 385, a combination of hydrocodone and paracetamol.\nOn 21 April 2016, American author and journalist Michelle McNamara died from an accidental overdose; medical examiners determined fentanyl was a contributing factor.\nOn 11 November 2016, Canadian video game composer Saki Kaskas died of a fentanyl overdose; he had been battling heroin addiction for over a decade.\nOn 15 November 2017, American rapper Lil Peep died of an accidental fentanyl overdose.\nOn 19 January 2018, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner said musician Tom Petty died from an accidental drug overdose as a result of mixing medications that included fentanyl, acetyl fentanyl, and despropionyl fentanyl (among others). He was reportedly treating \"many serious ailments\" that included a broken hip.\nOn 7 September 2018, American rapper Mac Miller died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, cocaine and alcohol.\nOn 16 December 2018, American tech entrepreneur Colin Kroll, founder of social media video-sharing app Vine and quiz app HQ Trivia, died from an overdose of fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine.\nOn 1 July 2019, American baseball player Tyler Skaggs died from pulmonary aspiration while under the influence of fentanyl, oxycodone, and alcohol.\nOn 1 January 2020, American rapper, singer, and songwriter Lexii Alijai died from accidental toxicity resulting from the combination of alcohol and fentanyl.\nOn 20 August 2020, American singer, songwriter, and musician Justin Townes Earle died from an accidental overdose caused by cocaine laced with fentanyl.\nOn 24 August 2020, Riley Gale, frontman for the Texas metal band Power Trip, died as a result of the toxic effects of fentanyl in a manner that was ruled accidental.\nOn 2 March 2021, American musician Mark Goffeney, also known as \"Big Toe\" (because being born without arms, he played guitar with his feet), died from an overdose of fentanyl.\nOn 22 April 2021, Digital Underground frontman, rapper, and musician Shock G died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, meth, and alcohol.\nOn 6 September 2021, actor Michael K. Williams, who performed as Omar Little on the HBO drama series The Wire, died from an overdose of fentanyl, parafluorofentanyl, heroin, and cocaine.\nOn 28 September 2022, rapper Coolio (Artis Leon Ivey, Jr.) died from an accidental overdose of fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine.\nOn 31 July 2023, Angus Cloud, best known for his portrayal of Fezco on the HBO drama series Euphoria, died from an accidental overdose of methamphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl, and benzodiazepines.\nOn 15 September 2023, an infant died at a daycare center in The Bronx, New York City, due to fentanyl contamination, which is also believed to have caused sickness in other children.\nOn 22 March 2024, Mark D'Wit was sentenced to a minimum of 37 years imprisonment for murdering Stephen and Carol Baxter in Essex, England on 9 April 2023 by giving them drinks laced with fentanyl.\n\nGovernmental usage: In August 2018, Nebraska became the first American state to use fentanyl to execute a prisoner. Carey Dean Moore, at the time one of the longest-serving death row inmates in the United States, was executed at the Nebraska State Penitentiary. Moore received a lethal injection, administered as an intravenous series of four drugs that included fentanyl citrate, to inhibit breathing and render the subject unconscious. The other drugs included diazepam as a tranquilizer, cisatracurium besylate as a muscle relaxant, and potassium chloride to stop the heart. The use of fentanyl in execution caused concern among death penalty experts because it was part of a previously untested drug cocktail. The execution was also protested by anti-death penalty advocates at the prison during the execution and later at the Nebraska State Capitol.\nRussian Spetsnaz security forces are suspected to have used a fentanyl analogue, or derivative (suspected to be carfentanil and remifentanil), to rapidly incapacitate people in the Moscow theater hostage crisis in 2002. The siege was ended, but many hostages died from the gas after their health was severely taxed during the days long siege. The Russian Health Minister later stated that the gas was based on fentanyl, but the exact chemical agent has not been clearly identified.\n\nRecalls: In February 2004, a leading fentanyl supplier, Janssen Pharmaceutica Products recalled one lot, and later, additional lots of fentanyl (brand name: Duragesic) patches because of seal breaches that might have allowed the medication to leak from the patch. A series of class II recalls was initiated in March 2004, and in February 2008, the ALZA Corporation recalled their 25 \u03bcg/h Duragesic patches due to a concern that small cuts in the gel reservoir could result in accidental exposure of patients or health care providers to the fentanyl gel. In April 2023, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA recalled 13 lots of their Fentanyl Buccal Tablets CII due to missing safety information sheets on how to properly administer their product. The corporation issued a consumer recall report and stressed the importance of safety in the use and administration of opioid therapeutics.\n\nVeterinary use: Fentanyl is commonly used for analgesia and as a component of balanced sedation and general anesthesia in small animal patients. In addition, its efficacy is higher than many other pure-opiate and synthetic pure-opioid agonists regarding vomiting, depth of sedation, and cardiovascular effects when given as a continuous infusion as well as a transdermal patch. As with other pure-opioid agonists, fentanyl has been associated with dysphoria in dogs.\nFurthermore, transdermal fentanyl's potency and short duration of action make it popular as an intra-operative and post-operative analgesic in cats and dogs. This is usually done with off-label fentanyl patches manufactured for humans with chronic pain. In 2012, a highly concentrated (50 mg/mL) transdermal solution, brand name Recuvyra, has become commercially available for dogs only. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to provide four days of analgesia after a single application before surgery. It is not approved for multiple doses or other species. The drug is also approved in Europe.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: \n\nExternal links: \nFentanyl (Report). National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). 8 July 2021.\n\n\n pubchem:\nFentanyl is a monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of the aryl amino group of N-phenyl-1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-amine with propanoic acid. It has a role as an opioid analgesic, a mu-opioid receptor agonist, an anaesthesia adjuvant, an intravenous anaesthetic, an adjuvant and an anaesthetic. It is a member of piperidines, an anilide and a monocarboxylic acid amide.\nFentanyl is a DEA Schedule II controlled substance. Substances in the DEA Schedule II have a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. It is a Opiates substance.\nFentanyl, a potent opioid agonist, was developed in the 1950s to fill a need for strong and rapid analgesia. Because of these characteristics, fentanyl is commonly used to treat chronic cancer pain or in anesthesia. Fentanyl is related to other opioids like [morphine] and [oxycodone].  Fentanyl's high potency has also made it a common adulterant in illicit drugs, especially heroin. In 2017, 47600 overdose deaths in the United States involved some opioid (over 2/3 of all overdose deaths). Opioid overdoses kill an average of 11 Canadians daily.  Fentanyl was FDA approved in 1968.\nFentanyl is an Opioid Agonist. The mechanism of action of fentanyl is as a Full Opioid Agonist.\nFentanyl is a synthetic, lipophilic phenylpiperidine opioid agonist with analgesic and anesthetic properties. Fentanyl selectively binds to and activates the mu-receptor in the central nervous system (CNS) thereby mimicking the effects of endogenous opiates. Activation of the mu-subtype opioid receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex and subsequently inhibits adenylate cyclase. This causes a decrease in intracellular cAMP which inhibits cAMP-mediated calcium influx into the cell via the calcium channels and thereby results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.\nFENTANYL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1968 and has 6 approved and 38 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA.\nA potent narcotic analgesic, abuse of which leads to habituation or addiction. It is primarily a mu-opioid agonist.

        "text1": "Title: Ketotifen\nwikipedia: Ketotifen is an antihistamine medication and a mast cell stabilizer used to treat allergic conditions such as conjunctivitis, asthma, and urticaria (hives). Ketotifen is available in ophthalmic (eye drops or drug-eluting contact lenses) and oral (tablets or syrup) forms: the ophthalmic form relieves eye itchiness and irritation associated with seasonal allergies, while the oral form helps prevent systemic conditions such as asthma attacks and allergic reactions. In addition to treating allergies, ketotifen has shown efficacy in managing systemic mast cell diseases such as mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which involve abnormal accumulation or activation of mast cells throughout the body. Ketotifen is also used for other allergic-type conditions like atopic dermatitis (eczema) and food allergies.\nKetotifen acts by blocking the H1 histamine receptors, which are found on various cells in the body, such as smooth muscle, endothelium, and nerve cells. This blocking prevents the binding of histamine to these receptors and thus reduces the symptoms of histamine-mediated reactions, such as itching, sneezing, wheezing, and swelling. Ketotifen also prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from immune cells (mast cells); this action helps reduce symptoms of conditions (including allergic conditions) by blocking the activation of these cells. In addition to its antihistaminic activity, ketotifen also functions as a leukotriene antagonist, which blocks inflammation-causing chemicals known as leukotrienes; it also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that regulates blood vessel dilation.\nKetotifen can have side effects, including drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, irritability, increased nosebleeds when taken orally, and temporary burning or stinging sensations in the eyes when used in the ophthalmic form. Ketotifen has contraindications for individuals with certain medical conditions, such as acute porphyrias or epilepsy. Controversies surrounding ketotifen include its classification as a first-generation or second-generation antihistamine due to varying criteria of classification.\nIn 2022, it was the 243rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Ketotifen, an antihistamine medication and a mast cell stabilizer, is most commonly sold as a salt with fumaric acid, ketotifen fumarate, and is available in two forms:\n\nin its ophthalmic form (eye drops or drug-eluting contact lenses), it is used to treat allergic conjunctivitis;\nin its oral form (tablets or syrup), it is used to prevent asthma attacks or anaphylaxis, as well as various mast cell, allergic-type disorders.\nKetotifen ophthalmic solution (eye drops) relieves and prevents eye itchiness and/or irritation associated with most seasonal allergies. It starts working within minutes after administering the drops. Ketotifen in the form of eye drops has not been studied in children under three years old, whereas drug-eluting contact lenses have not been studied in children under eleven years old.\nDrug-eluting contact lenses, which release ketotifen medication, are used to help prevent itchy eyes caused by allergies. The lenses can also correct vision problems like nearsightedness and farsightedness. These lenses are meant for people who don't have red eyes, can comfortably wear contact lenses, and have less than 1 degree of astigmatism.\nOral ketotifen is used to treat asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, chronic urticaria (hives), cold-induced urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, exercise-induced urticaria, systemic mast cell diseases such as mastocytosis and mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), as well as allergic and nonallergic anaphylaxis. Ketotifen has also shown efficacy in managing angioedema and food allergies.\nAs an antihistamine medication, ketotifen acts by blocking the H1 histamine receptors, which are found on various cells in the body, such as smooth muscle, endothelium, and nerve cells. This blocking prevents the binding of histamine to these receptors and thus reduces the symptoms of histamine-mediated reactions, such as itching, sneezing, wheezing, and swelling.\nAs a mast cell stabilizer to treat MCAS, oral ketotifen prevents the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from mast cells, which are immune cells that react to allergens. Therefore, ketotifen, by blocking a calcium channel essential for mast cell activation, helps reduce symptoms of allergic conditions. These allergic conditions include asthma, hay fever, and conjunctivitis caused by mast cell activation. Calcium channels are proteins in mast cell membranes that allow calcium ions to enter the cell, triggering the release of histamine and other inflammatory substances. When these channels open, calcium floods into the cells, causing them to degranulate. By blocking these channels, ketotifen prevents this process, reducing allergic reactions. In Canada, Europe, and Mexico, oral ketotifen is commonly prescribed for these indications (asthma, hay fever, and conjunctivitis caused by mast cell activation). In patients with MCAS, ketotifen reduces episodes of flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, diarrhea), respiratory symptoms (such as wheezing), and other systemic manifestations. Still, treatment plans for MCAS typically involve a combination of medications targeting different aspects of mast cell activation along with lifestyle modifications to minimize triggers.\nThe maximum antihistamine and mast cell stabilizing effect of oral ketotifen is achieved on long-term administration, and a period of at least 6-12 weeks is necessary for a maximum therapeutic effect to start. The sedation side effect decreases over time during such long-term administration, but the antihistamine and mast cell stabilizing properties persist even if administered for 12 months or longer.\nOral ketotifen is available at compounding pharmacies in the United States with a prescription requirement, still, the use of oral ketotifen is only approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adults and older children with asthma or allergic conditions. However, ketotifen eye drops are approved in the US for people who are at least three years of age. In the EU, ketotifen oral formulatios (syrup, tables and capsules) are approved by the European Medicines Agency for adult use. In the UK, ketotifen is available as tables and elixir (liquid).\nOral ketotifen can be used as a long-term control medication for asthma and wheeze in children, and it has been shown to improve the control of asthma by reducing the need for bronchodilators, decreasing symptoms, preventing exacerbations, and reducing the use of rescue oral steroids, ketotifen has also been found to be effective when used alone or in combination with other medications. Oral ketotifen is an alternative to inhaled therapy for asthma in children, especially for younger children who may have difficulty using inhalers.\nThe mean elimination half-life of oral ketotifen is 12 hours. Besides its anti-histaminic activity, it is also a functional leukotriene antagonist (a medication that blocks the action of leukotrienes, which are chemicals that cause inflammation and narrowing of the airways in some allergic and respiratory conditions) and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (a medication that blocks the enzymes that regulate the levels of cAMP and cGMP, which are molecules that control blood vessel dilation and smooth muscle relaxation in the body).\n\nContraindications: The eye drops are contraindicated for individuals who have a known hypersensitivity to ketotifen or any other ingredient in the formulation, whereas drug-eluting contact lenses are contraindicated for those who experience irritation from wearing contact lenses. Eye drops are not recommended for use in children under three years of age, whereas drug-eluting contact lenses are not recommended for children under eleven years of age.\nFor oral ketotifen, the contraindication is for known hypersensitivity to any component of the product. Caution should be taken on the following conditions:\n\nacute porphyrias (a group of rare disorders that occur when the body cannot make enough of a substance called heme, which is needed for red blood cells to carry oxygen, this causes a build-up of chemicals called porphyrins, which can damage the nerves and the skin) - unlike other histamines, ketotifen appears to be relatively safe in acute porphyria, still, caution should be taken\nepilepsy (a disorder causing recurrent seizures) -  ketotifen may increase the risk of seizures,\npyloroduodenal obstruction (a condition where the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine is blocked by something, such as a muscle, an ulcer, a tumor, or a gallstone),\nsusceptibility to angle-closure glaucoma (a condition where the iris, the colored part of the eye, bulges and blocks the drainage of fluid from the eye, causing high pressure and damage to the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain), and\nurinary retention (inability to urinate).\nThe use of ketotifen eye drops during pregnancy and lactation is considered safe, as absorption through the eye is limited. It is unlikely to cause any adverse effects in breastfeeding infants after maternal use. To minimize the amount of medication transferred to breast milk when using eye drops, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development advises to apply pressure on the tear duct near the corner of the eye for at least one minute and remove any excess solution with a tissue. Ketotifen safety when taken via the oral route (tablets or syrup) during pregnancy and lactation remains unknown; therefore, it is not recommended to use ketotifen orally during these periods until sufficient safety data becomes available.\n\nSide effects: Common side effects of ophthalmic use are eye redness and swelling. Less common are eye discharge, eye discomfort, eye pain, hives, increased itching of eyes, and rash. Ophthalmic use of ketotifen may also cause burning, stinging, or itching of the eyes, blurred vision, or increased sensitivity to light.\nSide effects of systemic (oral) use include drowsiness, weight gain (5.0\u20135.4 kilograms (11.0\u201311.9 lb)), dry mouth, irritability, and increased nosebleeds. Systemic use of ketotifen may also cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, or fatigue. In rare cases, systemic use of ketotifen may cause serious side effects such as anaphylaxis, liver dysfunction, blood disorders, or seizures. Systemic use of ketotifen may interact with other drugs that cause sedation, such as alcohol, antihistamines, opioids, benzodiazepines, or antidepressants. Systemic use of ketotifen may affect the results of some laboratory tests, such as skin tests for allergies or blood glucose levels.\n\nOverdose: The symptoms of ketotifen overdose are dose-dependent and may vary from mild to severe. The onset of symptoms may be delayed for several hours after ingestion, and the duration of symptoms may last for more than 24 hours.\nThe most common symptom of ketotifen overdose is significant sedation. Other symptoms may include confusion, disorientation, agitation, hallucinations, ataxia (impairment of voluntary muscle movement), tremor (involuntary regular muscle contraction), myoclonus (involuntary, irregular muscle twitch), nystagmus (dysfunction of eye movement), dysarthria (poor speech), and slurred speech.\nOther symptoms of ketotifen overdose may include tachycardia (fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat or pulse), hypotension (low blood pressure), convulsions, hyperexcitability (particularly in children), reversible coma, unusual tiredness or weakness, blurred vision, dizziness or fainting, loss of consciousness.\nThe symptoms of ketotifen overdose may be described according to the affected system of the body. The cardiovascular effects of ketotifen overdose may include tachycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. The respiratory effects may include respiratory depression, sleep apnea, and pulmonary edema. The gastrointestinal effects may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and pancreatitis. The renal effects may include acute renal failure and urinary retention. The hepatic effects may include hepatitis and jaundice. The hematologic effects may include anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy. The neurologic effects of ketotifen overdose may include convulsions, hyperexcitability, coma, and death. The risk of seizures is higher in children, especially those with a history of epilepsy or febrile seizures. The risk of coma and death is higher in adults, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions or concomitant use of other drugs that cause sedation or lower the seizure threshold.\nIn children, ketotifen overdose may lead to toxic encephalopathy with lifelong health consequences. There was a reported case of an overdose in a 4-month-old boy that led to growth retardation and mental deterioration.\n\nInteractions: In systemic (oral) administration, ketotifen has the potential to enhance the effects of sedatives, hypnotics, antihistamines, and alcohol. Interactions have been observed between oral ketotifen and oral hypoglycemic agents, antihistamines, and medications with sedative properties.\nOral ketotifen may interact with amphetamine and benzphetamine, which may decrease the activities of ketotifen.\nThe concomitant use of oral ketotifen with amifampridine, bupropion, donepezil, and pitolisant is not recommended.\nIn rare instances, patients who have been administered oral ketotifen with oral antidiabetic agents have exhibited a reversible decrease in thrombocyte count. As such, it is recommended to monitor thrombocyte counts in patients who are concurrently taking oral antidiabetic agents.\nSystemic use of ketotifen may decrease the effectiveness of benzylpenicilloyl polylysine as a diagnostic agent. Ketotifen may affect the results of some laboratory tests, such as skin tests for allergies or blood glucose levels. Ketotifen may interfere with the skin test reactions by suppressing the histamine response, leading to false-negative results.\nOphthalmic use of ketotifen may interact with contact lenses, as the eye drops may contain preservatives that can be absorbed by soft contact lenses and cause eye irritation.\n\nPharmacology: Ketotifen is a selective antihistamine \u2013 that is, an inverse agonist of the histamine H1 receptor (Ki = 0.166 nM) \u2013 and mast cell stabilizer. By preventing the degranulation of mast cells, ketotifen inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine and leukotrienes, which are implicated in allergic reactions. Ketotifen action is also based on its inhibition of serotonin release.\nKetotifen also plays a role in the prevention of accumulation of eosinophils, which are white blood cells that become active during allergic reactions and infections; as such, ketotifen helps in reducing inflammation this way.\nIn addition, ketotifen has weak anticholinergic (Ki = 204 nM for mAChTooltip muscarinic acetylcholine receptor) and antiserotonergic (Ki = 38.9 nM for 5-HT2A) activity. However, at the dosages in which it is typically used clinically, both the anticholinergic and antiserotonergic activity of ketotifen are said not to be appreciable.\nKetotifen is a lipophilic compound that can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and exert central nervous system effects, such as sedation, weight gain, and anticonvulsant activity. Ketotifen also has peripheral effects, such as inhibition of platelet aggregation, modulation of cytokine production, and enhancement of mucociliary clearance.\nKetotifen acts as a mast cell stabilizer by preventing the degranulation and release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cytokines, from mast cells. Ketotifen also inhibits the activation and migration of eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, which are involved in the inflammatory response and tissue damage in allergic and respiratory diseases.\nKetotifen has a dual mode of action as an antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer, which makes it effective in the prophylaxis and treatment of various allergic and respiratory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, dermatitis, urticaria, and anaphylaxis. Ketotifen can also reduce the bronchial hyperreactivity and airway inflammation that are characteristic of chronic asthma.\nKetotifen has a plasma half-life of about 12 hours. Ketotifen is extensively metabolized in the liver by oxidation and conjugation, and the metabolites are excreted in the urine and feces. The bioavailability of oral ketotifen is about 50% due to hepatic first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentration is reached in about 2 to 4 hours. The pharmacokinetics of ketotifen are not significantly affected by age, gender, or renal impairment, but may be altered by hepatic impairment or concomitant use of other drugs.\nKetotifen, like other antihistamines, is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, especially CYP3A4 in the liver. The CYP enzymes are responsible for the oxidation and demethylation of ketotifen, producing the major metabolites norketotifen and 10-hydroxyketotifen. Norketotifen is pharmacologically active and has a similar potency as ketotifen, while 10-hydroxyketotifen is inactive. The metabolites are then conjugated with glucuronic acid or sulfate and excreted in the urine and feces.\n\nClassification: Ketotifen is a noncompetitive H1-antihistamine and mast cell stabilizer.\nThere is no academic consensus on whether ketotifen should be classified as a medication belonging to the first or the second generations of antihistamine drugs; the classification can vary depending on the criteria used and the context of the study, and is primarily based on chemical structure, pharmacological properties, and side effect profiles of an antihistamine drug. First-generation H1 antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine, reduce skin reactivity for up to 24 hours, whereas ketotifen suppresses skin reactivity for over five days, a typical duration for the second generation of the class. Ketotifen is a tricyclic, benzocycloheptene-based compound with chemical structures similar to first-generation antihistamines such as azatadine, cyproheptadine, chlorpheniramine, and diphenhydramine, and other compounds with antihistamine properties such as pizotifen. The sedative effects of ketotifen are also a reason for differences in classification. First-generation antihistamines are well known for their sedating side effects due to their ability to penetrate the blood\u2013brain barrier. While ketotifen has some sedative properties, it is generally considered to have a milder sedative effect compared to traditional first-generation antihistamines, so this reduced sedation is one of the reasons why ketotifen is sometimes classified as a second-generation antihistamine.\n\nHistory: Ketotifen was patented in 1970 and came into medical use in 1976. Ketotifen was developed and patented by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (a part of Novartis), a Swiss company.\nKetotifen was approved for medical use in Canada in December 1990. Ketotifen was approved for medical use in the United States in July 1999. TA contact lens with ketotifen was approved for medical use in the United States in 2022.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nBrand names: Ketotifen is sold under various brand names worldwide, depending on country and formulation, with over 200 different names used. In the United States, ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution is marketed under brand name Zaditor, which is owned by Alcon Inc., a Swiss-American pharmaceutical company.\n\nLitigation: There was a litigation related to ketotifen. In 2021, the plaintiff, Edward C. Hanks, brought an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois against the defendants, Ned Hubbard and others, alleging that they violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution by acting with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. The plaintiff claimed that he suffered from a chronic eye condition that required medical attention and that the defendant, Dr. Hubbard, prescribed him ketotifen. The plaintiff further claimed that the ketotifen eye drops caused him adverse reactions, such as severe pain, burning, and blurred vision, and that the defendant, Dr. Hubbard, failed to offer him an alternative medication or refer him to an ophthalmologist. The plaintiff also claimed that he sustained permanent eye damage as a result of the ketotifen. The district court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The plaintiff appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which affirmed the district court's judgment on 7 February 2022.\n\nResearch: \n\nNorketotifen: Research directions for ketotifen include the investigation of norketotifen (NK), a metabolite of ketotifen. In vitro studies using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes suggest that NK may be the major demethylated hepatic metabolite of ketotifen. Unlike ketotifen, NK does not seem to induce severe sedative effects, potentially allowing for higher doses to be administered without sedation as a limiting factor. Furthermore, NK may probably have potent and dose-dependent inhibition of the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1, suggesting potential anti-inflammatory activity. thus, ketotifen can probably be considered a sedating prodrug that converts to NK, a nonsedating metabolite with anti-inflammatory properties, when used as an anti-inflammatory medication. The potential future applications of norketotifen are researched by Emergo Therapeutics, a US company.\n\nConditions: \n\nIncreased appetite and weight gain: The underlying mechanisms of why ketotifen (similarly to other antihistamine drugs such as astemizole, azelastine) may increase appetite and lead to weight gain in some people, are not fully understood.\nDifferent studies have shown conflicting results about the amount of weight gain caused by ketotifen. In one study (postmarketing surveillance), it was found that around 1 to 2 out of every 100 people who took the drug experienced weight gain, with adults gaining about 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) and children over the age of one gaining 2.8\u20133.3 kilograms (6.2\u20137.3 lb). However, in another study, adults gained a higher amount of weight: 5.0\u20135.4 kilograms (11.0\u201311.9 lb).\nKetotifen exhibits a chemical resemblance to pizotifen, a substance known for its appetite-stimulating properties. One proposed mechanism of the increase in appetite involves the inhibitory effect of ketotifen on the production of TNF-\u03b1, which is a cytokine that plays a role in regulating energy metabolism. TNF-\u03b1 can act directly on adipocytes (fat cells) to regulate the release of leptin. Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue and acts as a satiety signal by binding to receptors in the hypothalamus, where it inhibits appetite. By reducing TNF-\u03b1 production, ketotifen may lead to decreased leptin levels, reducing appetite control inhibition. Furthermore, ketotifen's influence on serotonin regulation could be involved in central serotonin disinhibition. Serotonin is known to have suppressant effects on appetite. It is suggested that ketotifen might cause a decrease in serotonin levels due to this regulatory influence. As a result, the decrease in serotonin function may lead to increased food intake tendencies and heightened appetite. Still, these potential mechanisms have been hypothesized based on limited evidence. Studies on mice suggest that caffeine or citrus aurantifolia oil may prevent weight-gain induced by ketotifen, but, this has not been confirmed on human subjects.\n\nIrritable bowel syndrome: Ketotifen is being studied in context of a possible link between abnormalities in intestinal mast cells and irritable bowel syndrome, but there are no solid results yet.\n\nReferences: \n\n== External links ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nCrystals (from ethyl acetate).

Other uses may include asthma and skin rashes for which it is taken by mouth. Onset of effects is within minutes when used in the eyes and within an hour when used in the nose. Effects last for up to 12 hours.\nCommon side effects include headache, sleepiness, change in taste, and sore throat. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking the release of a number of inflammatory mediators including histamine.\nAzelastine was patented in 1971 and came into medical use in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 124th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Azelastine nasal spray is indicated for the local treatment of the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis, such as rhinorrhea, sneezing and nasal pruritus in people five years of age and older. In some countries, it is also indicated for the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis in adults and children \u2265 12 years old. Azelastine eye drops are indicated for the local treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.\n\nSide effects: Azelastine is safe and well tolerated in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis. Bitter taste, headache, nasal burning and somnolence are the most frequently reported adverse events. US prescribing recommendations warn against the concurrent use of alcohol and/or other central nervous system depressants, but to date there have been no studies to assess the effects of azelastine nasal spray on the CNS in humans. More recent studies have shown similar degrees of somnolence (approx. 2%) compared with placebo treatment.\nThe most common side effect is a bitter taste (about 20% of people). Due to this, the manufacturer has produced another formulation of azelastine with sucralose. The problem of bitter taste may also be reduced by correct application of the nasal spray (i.e. slightly tipping the head forward and not inhaling the medication too deeply), or alternatively using the azelastine/sucralose formulation.\nIn addition, anosmia (loss in the ability to smell) can occur with nasal spray antihistamines (including both formulations of azelastine).\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Azelastine has a triple mode of action:\n\nAnti-histamine effect,\nMast-cell stabilizing effect and\nAnti-inflammatory effect.\n\nPharmacokinetics: The systemic bioavailability of azelastine is approximately 40% when administered intranasally. Maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) are observed within 2\u20133 hours. The elimination half life, steady-state volume of distribution and plasma clearance are 22 h, 14.5 L/kg and 0.5 L/h/kg respectively (based on intravenous and oral administration data). Approximately 75% of an oral dose is excreted in feces. Pharmacokinetics of orally administered azelastine is not affected by age, gender, or hepatic impairment.\n\nMetabolism: Azelastine is oxidatively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family into its active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, and two inactive carboxylic acid metabolites.\n\nChemical properties: The chemical nomenclature of azelastine is (\u00b1)-1-(2H)-phthalazinone, 4-[(4-chlorophenyl) methyl]-2-(hexahydro-1-methyl-1H-azepin-4-yl)-monohydrochloride.

It is taken by mouth.\nCommon side effects include headache, feeling tired, diarrhea, and swelling in the legs. More severe side effects include worsening asthma, blocking the ability to recognize low blood sugar, and worsening heart failure. There are concerns that use during pregnancy may be harmful to the baby.\nBisoprolol was patented in 1976 and approved for medical use in 1986. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992.\nBisoprolol is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 249th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: Bisoprolol is used for prevention of cardiovascular events following a heart attack in patients with risk factors for disease progression, in the management of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and as a second-line agent for hypertension.\nBisoprolol may be beneficial in the treatment of high blood pressure, but it is not recommended as a first-line antihypertensive agent. It can be an adjunct to first-line antihypertensive agents in patients with accompanying comorbidities, for example, congestive heart failure, where selected beta blockers can be added in patients who remain mildly to moderately symptomatic despite appropriate doses of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor.\nIn cardiac ischemia, the drug is used to reduce the activity of the heart muscle, thereby reducing its oxygen and nutrient demands and allowing its reduced blood supply to still transport sufficient amounts of oxygen and nutrients to meet its needs.\n\nSide effects: An overdose of bisoprolol can lead to fatigue, hypotension, hypoglycemia, bronchospasms, and bradycardia. Bronchospasms and hypoglycemia occur because at high doses, the drug can be an antagonist for \u03b22 adrenergic receptors located in the lungs and liver. Bronchospasm occurs due to the blockage of \u03b22 receptors in the lungs. Hypoglycemia occurs due to decreased stimulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver via \u03b22 receptors.\nThere have been no reported cases of clinically evident drug-induced liver injury associated with bisoprolol.\n\nCautions: Non-selective beta-blockers should be avoided in people with asthma or bronchospasm as they may cause exacerbations and worsening of symptoms. \u03b21 selective beta-blockers like bisoprolol have not been shown to cause an increase in asthma exacerbations, and may be cautiously tried in those with controlled, mild-to-moderate asthma with cardiac comorbidities.\nA 2014 meta-analysis found that unlike non-selective beta-blockers, \u03b21  selective beta-blockers (bisoprolol) showed only a small impact on lung function, with patients remaining responsive to salbutamol (\u03b22 -agonist) rescue therapy and endorses the use of bisoprolol in select patients with controlled asthma. This was supported by a 2020 clinical trial where bisoprolol had no significant impact on bronchodilation post salbutamol administration.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nMechanism of action: Bisoprolol is cardioprotective because it selectively and competitively blocks catecholamine (adrenaline) stimulation of \u03b21 adrenergic receptors (adrenoreceptors), which are mainly found in the heart muscle cells and heart conduction tissue (cardiospecific), but also found in juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. Normally, adrenaline and noradrenaline stimulation of the \u03b21 adrenoreceptor activates a signalling cascade (Gs protein and cAMP) which ultimately leads to increased myocardial contractility and increased heart rate of the heart muscle and heart pacemaker, respectively.\nBisoprolol competitively blocks the activation of this cascade, so decreases the adrenergic tone/stimulation of the heart muscle and pacemaker cells. Decreased adrenergic tone shows less contractility of heart muscle and lowered heart rate of pacemakers.\n\n\u03b21-selectivity: Bisoprolol \u03b21-selectivity is especially important in comparison to other nonselective beta blockers. The effects of the drug are limited to areas containing \u03b21 adrenoreceptors, which are mainly the heart and part of the kidney. Bisoprolol, whilst \u03b21 adrenoceptor selective can help patients to avoid certain side-effects associated with non-selective beta-blocker activity at additional adrenoceptors (\u03b11 and \u03b22), it does not signify its superiority in treating beta-blocker indicated cardiac conditions such as heart failure but could prove beneficial to patients with specific comorbidities.\nBisoprolol has a higher degree of \u03b21-selectivity compared to atenolol, metoprolol and betaxolol. With a selectivity ranging from being 11 to 15 times more selective for \u03b21 over \u03b22. However, nebivolol is approximately 3.5 times more \u03b21-selective.\n\nRenin-angiotensin system: Bisoprolol inhibits renin secretion by about 65% and tachycardia by about 30%.\n\nPharmacokinetics: After ingestion, bisoprolol is absorbed and has a high bioavailability of approximately 90% with a plasma half-life of 10\u201312 hours. Typically, half the circulating bisoprolol is  metabolized by the liver, the rest passing unchanged through the kidneys before elimination; less than 2% may be excreted in the feces.\nBisoprolol is soluble in both lipids and water. It is classified as a beta blocker with moderate lipophilicity and hence intermediate potential for crossing the blood\u2013brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects than highly lipophilic beta blockers like propranolol but greater such effects than beta blockers with low lipophilicity like atenolol.\nThe plasma protein binding of bisoprolol is approximately 35%, the volume of distribution is 3.5 L/kg and the total clearance is approximately 15 L/h. Bisoprolol is eliminated from the body in two ways - 50% of the substance is converted in the liver to inactive metabolites, which are then excreted in the kidneys. The remaining 50% is eliminated unchanged via the kidneys. Since elimination is equal in liver and kidney, no dose adjustment is required in patients with hepatic or renal impairment.\nThe pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol are linear and independent of age.\nIn patients with chronic heart failure, the plasma level of bisoprolol is higher and the half-life is longer than in healthy subjects when compared across studies. There is a lack of evidence directly comparing bisoprolol pharmacokinetics between healthy subjects and chronic heart failure subjects.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nBrand names: In India, it is sold under the brand name Concor,Bisotab.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nBisoprolol is a secondary alcohol and a secondary amine.

This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called the aqueous humor) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due to glaucoma. \nIt was patented in 1975 and approved for medical use in 1983.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nHypertension: Betaxolol is most commonly ingested orally alone or with other medications for the management of essential hypertension. It is a cardioselective beta blocker, targeting beta-1 adrenergic receptors found in the cardiac muscle. Blood pressure is decreased by the mechanism of blood vessels relaxing and improving the flow of blood.\n\nGlaucoma: Ophthalmic betaxolol is an available treatment for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and optical hypertension. Betaxolol effectively prevents the increase of intracellular calcium, which leads to increased production of the aqueous humor. In the context of open angle glaucoma, increased aqueous humor produced by ciliary bodies increases intraocular pressure, causing degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve.\nFurthermore, betaxolol is additionally able to protect retinal neurones following topical application from excitotoxicity or ischemia-reperfusion, providing a neuroprotective effect. This is thought to be attributed to its capacity to attenuate neuronal calcium and sodium influx. Betaxolol is also an effective treatment for Intraocular pressure\n\nParonychia: One study showed that topical betaxolol can be used in treating relapsed paronychia.\n\nContraindications: Hypersensitivity to the drug\nPatients with sinus bradycardia, heart block greater than first degree, cardiogenic shock, and overt cardiac failure\n\nSide effects: The adverse side-effects of betaxolol can be categorized into local and systemic effects. The local effects include:\n\ntransient irritation (20-40% of patients)\nburning\npruritus, or general itching\npunctate keratitis\nblurry vision\nSystemically, patients taking betaxolol might experience:\n\nbradycardia\nhypotension\nfatigue\nsexual impotence\nhair loss\nconfusion\nheadache\ndizziness\nbronchospasm at higher doses\ncardiac problems such as arrhythmia, bundle branch block, myocardial infarction, sinus arrest, and congestive heart failure\nmental effects such as depression, disorientation, vertigo, sleepwalking, rhinitis\ndysuria\nmetabolic side effects such as an increase in LDL cholesterol levels\ncan mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia diabetic patients\n\nHistory: Betaxolol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ocular use as a 0.5% solution (Betoptic) in 1985 and as a 0.25% solution (Betoptic S) in 1989.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nBrand names: Brand names include Betoptic, Betoptic S, Lokren, Kerlone.\n\nSee also: Levobetaxolol\nCicloprolol\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Kerlone prescribing information\n\n\n pubchem:\nBetaxolol is a propanolamine that is 3-aminopropane-1,2-diol in which the hydrogen of the primary hydoxy is substituted by a 4-[2-(cyclopropylmethoxy)ethyl]phenyl group and one of the hydrogens attached to the amino group is substituted by isopropyl. It is a selective beta1-receptor blocker and is used in the treatment of glaucoma as well as hypertension, arrhythmias, and coronary heart disease. It is also used to reduce non-fatal cardiac events in patients with heart failure.

Betaxolol has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent drug induced liver injury.\nBetaxolol is a racemic mixture and selective beta-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist with antihypertensive and anti-glaucoma activities and devoid of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Betaxolol selectively and competitively binds to and blocks beta-1 adrenergic receptors in the heart, thereby decreasing cardiac contractility and rate. This leads to a reduction in cardiac output and lowers blood pressure. When applied topically in the eye, this agent reduces aqueous humor secretion and lowers the intraocular pressure (IOP). In addition, betaxolol prevents the release of renin, a hormone secreted by the kidneys that causes constriction of blood vessels.\nBETAXOLOL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1985 and has 5 approved and 2 investigational indications.\nA cardioselective beta-1-adrenergic antagonist with no partial agonist activity.\nSee also: Betaxolol Hydrochloride (has salt form).\nsafety: Irritant and Health Hazard\nsmiles: CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=C(C=C1)CCOCC2CC2)O\nforumla: C18H29NO3\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 307.4 g/mol\nXLogP3: 2.8\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 2\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 4\nRotatable Bond Count: 11\nExact Mass: 307.21474379 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 307.21474379 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 50.7\nHeavy Atom Count: 22\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 286\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 1\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text1": "Title: Muscimol\nwikipedia: Muscimol (also known as agarin or pantherine) is one of the principal psychoactive constituents of Amanita muscaria and related species of mushroom. Muscimol is a potent and selective orthosteric agonist for the GABAA receptor and displays sedative-hypnotic, depressant and hallucinogenic psychoactivity.  This colorless or white solid is classified as an isoxazole.\nMuscimol underwent a phase I clinical trial for epilepsy,  but the trial was discontinued.\nMuscimol, an agonist for the GABAA receptor, was able to significantly alleviate pain in its peak effect, recent studies from 2023 show. It has since been federally banned in Australia and is pending FDA review in the United States, but scientists believe it may relieve pain as well as some opioids without much of the risk of addiction associated with opioids.\n\nBiochemistry: The main natural sources of muscimol are fungi of the genus Amanita, such as Amanita muscaria (fly agaric) and Amanita pantherina (panther amanita). It is produced in the mushrooms along with muscarine (which is present in trace amounts and it is not active), muscazone, and ibotenic acid. In A. muscaria, the layer just below the skin of the cap contains the highest amount of muscimol, and is therefore the most psychoactive portion.\nMuscimol is recognized as a potent agonist for ionotropic GABA-A receptors. By mimicking the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, muscimol activates these receptors, leading to the opening of chloride channels and subsequent hyperpolarization of neurons. This results in decreased neuronal excitability, which is crucial for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system.\nThe biochemical properties of muscimol make it a valuable tool for investigating GABAergic mechanisms. Its high affinity and specificity for GABA-A receptors allow researchers to study synaptic transmission, neural circuit dynamics, and the overall role of GABAergic inhibition in various physiological and pathological states.\n\nPharmacology: Muscimol is a potent GABAA agonist, activating the receptor for the brain's principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. Muscimol binds to the same site on the GABAA receptor complex as GABA itself, as opposed to other GABAergic drugs such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines which bind to separate regulatory sites. GABAA receptors are widely distributed in the brain, and so when muscimol is administered, it alters neuronal activity in multiple regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. While muscimol is normally thought of as a selective GABAA agonist with exceptionally high affinity to GABAA-delta  receptors, it is also a partial agonist at the GABAA-rho receptor, and so its range of effects results from a combined action on more than one GABAA receptor subtype.\nScientific studies have shown that dosing of the active ingredient muscimol is usually not precise as it has to be extracted from dried amanita mushroom. However, a psychoactive dose of muscimol is reported to be between 8 and 15 mg. As little as a gram of dried Amanita muscaria button may contain this amount of muscimol; however, the potency varies greatly among mushrooms.\nWhen consumed, a substantial percentage of muscimol goes un-metabolized and thus excreted in urine, a phenomenon exploited by Siberian practitioners of the traditional entheogenic use of Amanita muscaria.\nIn patients with Huntington's disease and chronic schizophrenia, oral doses of muscimol have been found to cause a rise of both prolactin and growth hormone.\nDuring a test involving rabbits connected to an EEG, muscimol presented with a distinctly synchronized EEG tracing.  This is substantially different from serotonergic psychedelics, with which brainwave patterns generally show a desynchronization. In higher doses (2 mg/kg via IV), the EEG will show characteristic spikes.\n\nMechanism of action: Muscimol primarily functions as a GABA-A receptor agonist, mimicking the action of GABA, the main inhibitory neurotransmitter, in the central nervous system.\n\nEffects: Muscimol, as a GABA-A receptor agonist, has shown diverse pharmacological effects, spanning neuroprotective, anti-nociceptive, and anti-epileptic activity.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the following effects of muscimol:\n\nNeurotransmission Modulation: By mimicking GABA and binding to GABA-A receptors, muscimol enhances inhibitory neurotransmission. This results in reduced neuronal firing rates, contributing to the overall calming effect on the CNS. This modulation is crucial in maintaining the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signals in the brain.\nMigraine and Headache: Studies on migraine models demonstrated that extrasynaptic GABA-A receptor agonists like muscimol could prevent migraine-like phenotypes, offering new avenues for migraine treatment.\nDepressant Effects: By enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission, muscimol acts as a CNS depressant. This can lead to muscle relaxation, reduction in anxiety.\nAntinociceptive Properties: Muscimol has been found to have antinociceptive effects when used in combination with citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This additive effect highlights muscimol's potential in pain management.\nDecision Making and Cognitive Function: Research on the role of the rat prelimbic cortex indicated that muscimol can influence decision-making processes. By infusing muscimol, researchers observed significant changes in cortical activity, which are crucial for understanding cognitive functions and cognitive disorders.\nCerebral Ischemic Injury: Muscimol's role in alleviating cerebral ischemic injury was explored, revealing its ability to suppress oxidative stress, autophagy, and apoptosis pathways. This research underscores muscimol's potential in treating ischemic conditions.\nPain Management: Activation of 5-HT5A receptors in the ventrolateral orbital cortex, alongside GABA-A receptor modulation by muscimol, showed significant antinociceptive effects in models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory pain.\nEpilepsy Models: In studies involving absence epilepsy models, muscimol demonstrated effects on T-type calcium channels and GABA receptors, providing insights into its anticonvulsant properties.\nSubstance Use Disorders: Research into sex differences in GABA receptor regulation highlighted muscimol's potential in addressing cocaine use disorder, emphasizing its role in GABAergic modulation.\nNeurological Pathways: Investigations into neural pathways for internal bias and sensory information interaction in decision-making processes showed the significant impact of muscimol on visual cortex neurons.\n\nClinical research: Muscimol underwent a phase I clinical trial for epilepsy in 2012, but this trial was discontinued. \nA handful of exploratory clinical trials (n\u226410) probing the utility of muscimol in the treatment of schizophrenia, Huntington's disease, and tardive dyskinesia occurred between 1977-1982. The clinical investigation of muscimol in these conditions was superseded by gaboxadol, a conformationally constrained derivative of muscimol. Neither drug appeared to be efficacious in the treatment of Huntington's disease or L-dopa/neuroleptic induced dyskinesia.\n\nMuscimol-based products: Muscimol, a psychoactive compound derived from the ibotenic acid found in certain mushrooms, particularly Amanita muscaria, has garnered significant interest due to its unique effects on the nervous system. Muscimol binds to GABA receptors in the brain, resulting in its sedative and hallucinogenic properties. Muscimol-based products are currently being investigated for their potential therapeutic applications, especially in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and other neurological disorders. The psychoactive nature of muscimol necessitates stringent regulation and cautious usage to ensure safety. However, ongoing research aims to harness its medicinal benefits in a controlled context, highlighting the broader scientific interest in natural compounds as potential sources for novel medical treatments.\n\nChemistry: \n\nStructure: Muscimol was first isolated from Amanita pantherina by Onda in 1964, and thought to be an amino acid or peptide.  Structure was then elucidated by Takemoto, Eugster, and Bowden.  Muscimol is a semi-rigid isoxazole containing both alcohol and aminomethyl substituents.  Muscimol is commonly portrayed as a tautomer, where it adopts an amide-like configuration.  It is also commonly shown as a zwitterion.\n\nIsolation: Muscimol can be extracted from the flesh of the Amanita muscaria by treatment with boiling water, followed by rapid cooling, and further treatment with a basic resin.  This is washed with water, and eluted with acetic acid using column chromatography.  The eluate is freeze dried, dissolved in water, and passed down a column of cellulose phosphate.  A subsequent elution with ammonium hydroxide and recrystallization from alcohol results in pure muscimol.\nIn instances where pure muscimol is not required, such as recreational or spiritual use, a crude extract is often prepared by simmering dried Amanita muscaria in water for thirty minutes.\n\nChemical synthesis: Muscimol was synthesized in 1965 by Gagneux, who utilized a bromo-isoxazole starting material in a two step reaction.  3-bromo-5-aminomethyl-isoxazole (1) was refluxed in a mixture of methanol and potassium hydroxide for 30 hours, resulting in 3-methoxy-5-aminomethyl-isoxazole (2) with a yield of 60%. \n\n(2) was then refluxed in concentrated hydrochloric acid to hydrolyze the methoxy group, and the zwitterion crystallized from a solution of methanol and tetrahydrofuran after the addition of triethylamine, resulting in a 50% yield.\n\nChemists report having struggled to reproduce these results. More dependable and scalable procedures have been developed, two examples being the syntheses of McCarry and Varasi.\nMcCarry's synthesis is a three step synthesis involving a lithium acetylide produced from propargyl chloride.  The acetylide (3), was dissolved in ether, cooled to -40 \u00b0C, and treated with excess ethyl chloroformate to afford ethyl 4-chlorotetrolate (4) in a 70% yield. (4) was then added to a solution of water, methanol and hydroxylamine at -35 \u00b0C.  At a pH of between 8.5 and 9, the isoxazole (5) was recovered in a 41% yield.  Muscimol was formed in a 65% yield when (5) was dissolved in a saturated solution of methanol and anhydrous ammonia and heated from 0 \u00b0C to 50 \u00b0C.  The total yield was 18.7%.\n\nVarasi's synthesis is notable for its inexpensive starting materials and mild conditions.  It begins with the combination of 2,3-Dichloro-1-propene (6), potassium bicarbonate, water, and dibromoformaldoxime (7) (which is a well known precursor of bromo nitriloxyde, a reactive dipole for regioselective Diels-Alder cycloadditions, which forms in alkali), all dissolved in ethyl acetate.  5-Chloromethyl-3-bromoisoxazole (8) was extracted with an experimental yield of 81%. 5-Aminomethyl-3-bromoisoxazole (9) was formed in 90% yield by the combination of (8) and ammonium hydroxide in dioxane. \n\n(9) was then refluxed with potassium hydroxide in methanol to generate 5-Aminomethyl-3-methoxyisoxazole (10) with a 66% yield.  Subsequent reflux of (10) with hydrobromic acid and acetic acid generated muscimol with a yield of 62%.  The overall synthetic yield was 30%.\n\nToxicity: The toxicity and safety profile of Muscimol have been studied in various contexts, both experimental and clinical.\n\nDose-Dependent Effects in Primates: A study on nonhuman primates indicated that muscimol, when administered in escalating doses, caused reversible hyperkinesia and dyskinesias at higher doses (up to 88.8 mM), but no long-term toxicity was observed on histological examination.\nThe median lethal dose in mice is 3.8 mg/kg s.c, 2.5 mg/kg i.p.  The LD50 in rats is 4.5 mg/kg i.v, 45 mg/kg orally.\n\nAnticonvulsant Properties: Muscimol has shown potential as an anticonvulsant, blocking seizures induced by various agents in animal models without causing significant toxicity at therapeutic doses.\n\nHuman Poisoning Cases: A retrospective review of muscimol poisoning cases from Amanita mushrooms indicated that symptoms included gastrointestinal upset, CNS excitation, but no deaths were reported. Most symptoms resolved within 24 hours.\n\nDistribution and Metabolism: Studies on muscimol's distribution in rats showed it enters the brain and is metabolized rapidly, suggesting that its toxicity is low when used in controlled doses.\nMuscimol exhibits dose-dependent effects with higher doses leading to significant, but reversible, CNS symptoms. Its toxicity appears to be low when used in controlled environments, with no long-term damage observed in animal studies and human cases resolving without severe outcomes. However, caution is advised with its use due to its potent effects on the central nervous system.\n\nLegal status: \n\nAustralia: Muscimol is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance \"which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.\"\n\nUnited States: Neither Amanita muscaria nor muscimol is considered a controlled substance by the Federal government of the United States.  This means that cultivation, possession, and distribution are unregulated by the United States Federal Government. The legality of Amanita muscaria and muscimol as ingredients in food is unclear since neither are approved as food additives by the FDA. However, agriculture regulators in Florida actioned against one seller of Amanita products after the agency had determined such products were considered adulterated under state law.\nMuscimol may be regulated on a state level.  Louisiana State Act 159 banned the possession and cultivation of the Amanita muscaria except for ornamental or aesthetic purposes.  Except as a constituent of lawfully manufactured food or dietary supplements, the act outlaws preparations of the Amanita muscaria intended for human consumption, including muscimol.\n\nSee also: \n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Psychoactive Amanitas on Erowid\n\n\n pubchem:\nCrystals.

        "text2": "Title: Gaboxadol\nwikipedia: Gaboxadol, also known as 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP), is a conformationally constrained derivative of the alkaloid muscimol that was first synthesized in 1977 by the Danish chemist Poul Krogsgaard-Larsen. In the early 1980s gaboxadol was the subject of a series of pilot studies that tested its efficacy as an analgesic and anxiolytic, as well as a treatment for tardive dyskinesia, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and spasticity. It was not until 1996 that researchers attempted to harness gaboxadol's frequently reported sedative \"adverse effect\" for the treatment of insomnia, resulting in a series of clinical trials sponsored by Lundbeck and Merck. In March, 2007, Merck and Lundbeck cancelled work on the drug, citing safety concerns and the failure of an efficacy trial. It acts on the GABA system, but in a different way from benzodiazepines, Z-Drugs, and barbiturates. Lundbeck states that gaboxadol also increases deep sleep (stage 4). Unlike benzodiazepines, gaboxadol does not demonstrate reinforcement in mice or baboons despite activation of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area.\nIn 2015, Lundbeck sold its rights to the molecule to Ovid Therapeutics, whose plan is to develop it for FXS and Angelman syndrome. It is known internally in Ovid as OV101.\n\nPharmacology: Gaboxadol is a supra-maximal agonist at \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4, low-potency agonist at \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32, partial agonist at \u03b14\u03b23\u03b3, and antagonist at \u03c11 GABAA receptors. Its affinity for extrasynaptic \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 GABAA receptors is 10-fold greater than other subtypes. Gaboxadol has a unique affinity for extrasynaptic \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 GABAA receptors, which mediate tonic inhibition and are typically activated by ambient, low levels of GABA in the extrasynaptic space. \nCompared to muscimol, gaboxadol binds less potently to \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 GABAA receptors (EC50 .2\u03bcM vs 13\u03bcM), but is capable of evoking a greater maximum response (Emax 120% vs 224%). The supra-maximial efficacy of gabaxadol at \u03b14\u03b23\u03b4 GABAA receptors has been attributed to an increase in the duration and frequency of channel openings relative to the endogenous agonist GABA.\n\nClinical studies: Gaboxadol produced effects in clinical studies including sedation, euphoria, and dissociation or perceptual changes. It showed less euphoria and misuse potential, more negative and dissociative effects, and fewer sedative effects than zolpidem at the assessed doses.\n\nSee also: Muscimol\nAmanita muscaria\nCI-966\nGanaxolone\nIbotenic acid\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\nH.

        "text1": "Title: Acetazolamide\nwikipedia: Acetazolamide, sold under the trade name Diamox among others, is a medication used to treat glaucoma, epilepsy, acute mountain sickness, periodic paralysis, idiopathic intracranial hypertension (raised brain pressure of unclear cause), heart failure and to alkalinize urine. It may be used long term for the treatment of open angle glaucoma and short term for acute angle closure glaucoma until surgery can be carried out. It is taken by mouth or injection into a vein. Acetazolamide is a first generation carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and it decreases the ocular fluid and osmolality in the eye to decrease intraocular pressure.\nCommon side effects include numbness, ringing in the ears, loss of appetite, vomiting, and sleepiness. It is not recommended in those with significant kidney problems, liver problems, or who are allergic to sulfonamides. Acetazolamide is in the diuretic and carbonic anhydrase inhibitor families of medication. It works by decreasing the formation of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate from carbon dioxide and water.\nAcetazolamide came into medical use in 1952. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Acetazolamide is available as a generic medication.\n\nMedical uses: It is used in the treatment of glaucoma, drug-induced edema, heart failure-induced edema, epilepsy and in reducing intraocular pressure after surgery. It has also been used in the treatment of altitude sickness, M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, increased intracranial pressure and neuromuscular disorders. Acetazolamide is also used in the critical care setting to stimulate respiratory drive in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as an off-label indication.\nIn epilepsy, the main use of acetazolamide is in menstrual-related epilepsy and as an add on to other treatments in refractory epilepsy. Though various websites on the internet report that acetazolamide can be used to treat dural ectasia in individuals with Marfan syndrome, the only supporting evidence for this assertion exists from a small study of 14 patients which was not peer-reviewed or submitted for publication. Several published cases of intracranial hypotension related to Marfan syndrome would warrant caution in using acetazolamide in these patients unless there is a clear indication, as it could lower intracranial pressure further. A 2012 review and meta-analysis found that there was \"limited supporting evidence\" but that acetazolamide \"may be considered\" for the treatment of central (as opposed to obstructive) sleep apnea.\nIt has also been used to prevent methotrexate-induced kidney damage by alkalinizing the urine, hence speeding up methotrexate excretion by increasing its solubility in urine. There is some evidence to support its use to prevent hemiplegic migraine.\n\nHigh altitude sickness: Acetazolamide is also used for the treatment of acute mountain sickness. In the prevention or treatment of mountain sickness, acetazolamide inhibits the ability of the kidneys to reabsorb bicarbonate, the conjugate base of carbonic acid. Increasing the amount of bicarbonate excreted in the urine leads to acidification of the blood. Because the body senses CO2 concentration indirectly via blood pH (increase in CO2 causes a decrease in pH), acidifying the blood through decreased renal reabsorption of bicarbonate is sensed as an increase in CO2. This, in turn, causes the body to increase minute ventilation (the amount of air breathed per minute) in order to \"breathe off\" CO2, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood. Acetazolamide is not an immediate cure for acute mountain sickness; rather, it speeds up (or, when taking before traveling, forces the body to early start) part of the acclimatization process which in turn helps to relieve symptoms. Acetazolamide is still effective if started early in the course of mountain sickness. As prevention, it is started one day before travel to altitude and continued for the first two days at altitude.\n\nPregnancy and lactation: Acetazolamide is pregnancy category B3 in Australia, which means that studies in rats, mice and rabbits in which acetazolamide was given intravenously or orally caused an increased risk of fetal malformations, including defects of the limbs. Despite this, there is insufficient evidence from studies in humans to either support or discount this evidence.\nLimited data are available on the effects of nursing mothers taking acetazolamide. Therapeutic doses create low levels in breast milk and are not expected to cause problems in infants.\n\nSide effects: Common adverse effects of acetazolamide include the following: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black stool, polyuria, kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia). Whereas less common adverse effects include Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias.\n\nContraindications: Contraindications include:\n\nHyperchloremic acidosis\nHypokalemia (low blood potassium)\nHyponatremia (low blood sodium)\nAdrenal insufficiency\nImpaired kidney function\nHypersensitivity to acetazolamide or other sulphonamides.\nMarked liver disease or impairment of liver function, including cirrhosis because of the risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy. Acetazolamide decreases ammonia clearance.\n\nInteractions: It is possible that it might interact with:\n\nAmphetamines, because it increases the pH of the renal tubular urine, hence reducing the clearance of amphetamines.\nOther carbonic anhydrase inhibitors\u2014potential for additive inhibitory effects on carbonic anhydrase and hence potential for toxicity.\nCiclosporin, may increase plasma levels of ciclosporin.\nAntifolates such as trimethoprim, methotrexate, pemetrexed and raltitrexed.\nHypoglycemics, acetazolamide can both increase or decrease blood glucose levels.\nLithium, increases excretion, hence reducing therapeutic effect.\nMethenamine compounds, reduces the urinary excretion of methenamines.\nPhenytoin, reduces phenytoin excretion, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.\nPrimidone, reduces plasma levels of primidone. Hence reducing anticonvulsant effect.\nQuinidine, reduces urinary excretion of quinidine, hence increasing the potential for toxicity.\nSalicylates, potential for severe toxicity.\nSodium bicarbonate, potential for kidney stone formation.\nAnticoagulants, cardiac glycosides, may have their effects potentiated by acetazolamide.\n\nMechanism of action: Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, hence causing the accumulation of carbonic acid. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme found in red blood cells and many other tissues that catalyses the following reaction:\n\nH2CO3 \u21cc H2O + CO2\nhence lowering blood pH, by means of the following reaction that carbonic acid undergoes:\n\nH2CO3 \u21cc HCO3\u2212 + H+\nwhich has a pKa of 6.3.\nThe mechanism of diuresis involves the proximal tubule of the kidney. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is found here, allowing the reabsorption of bicarbonate, sodium, and chloride. By inhibiting this enzyme, these ions are excreted, along with excess water, lowering blood pressure, intracranial pressure, and intraocular pressure. A general side effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors is loss of potassium due to this function. By excreting bicarbonate, the blood becomes acidic, causing compensatory hyperventilation with deep respiration (Kussmaul breathing), increasing levels of oxygen and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide in the blood.\nIn the eye this results in a reduction in aqueous humour.\nBicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) has a pKa of 10.3 with carbonate (CO32\u2212), far further from physiologic pH (7.35\u20137.45), and so it is more likely to accept a proton than to donate one, but it is also far less likely for it to do either, thus bicarbonate will be the major species at physiological pH.\nUnder normal conditions in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney, most of the carbonic acid (H2CO3) produced intracellularly by the action of carbonic anhydrase quickly dissociates in the cell to bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) and an H+ ion (a proton), as previously mentioned. The bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) exits at the basal portion of the cell via sodium (Na+) symport and chloride (Cl\u2212) antiport and re-enters circulation, where it may accept a proton if blood pH decreases, thus acting as a weak, basic buffer. The remaining H+ left over from the intracellular production of carbonic acid (H2CO3) exits the apical (urinary lumen) portion of the cell by Na+ antiport, acidifying the urine. There, it may join with another bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) that dissociated from its H+ in the lumen of the urinary space only after exiting the proximal convoluted kidney cells/glomerulus as carbonic acid (H2CO3) because bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) itself can not diffuse across the cell membrane in its polar state. This will replenish carbonic acid (H2CO3) so that it then may be reabsorbed into the cell as itself or CO2 and H2O (produced via a luminal carbonic anhydrase). As a result of this whole process, there is a greater net balance of H+ in the urinary lumen than bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212), and so this space is more acidic than physiologic pH. Thus, there is an increased likelihood that any bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) that was left over in the lumen diffuses back into the cell as carbonic acid, CO2, or H2O.\nIn short, under normal conditions, the net effect of carbonic anhydrase in the urinary lumen and cells of the proximal convoluted tubule is to acidify the urine and transport bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) into the body. Another effect is excretion of Cl\u2212 as it is needed to maintain electroneutrality in the lumen, as well as the reabsorption of Na+ into the body.\nThus, by disrupting this process with acetazolamide, urinary Na+ and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) are increased, and urinary H+ and Cl\u2212 are decreased. Inversely, serum Na+ and bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) are decreased, and serum H+ and Cl\u2212 are increased. H2O generally follows sodium, and so this is how the clinical diuretic effect is achieved, which reduces blood volume and thus preload on the heart to improve contractility and reduce blood pressure, or achieve other desired clinical effects of reduced blood volume such as reducing edema or intracranial pressure.\n\nHistory: An early description of this compound (as 2-acetylamino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-5-sulfonamide) and its synthesis has been patented.\n\nResearch: Smaller clinical trials have also shown promising results in the treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nAcetazolamide can cause developmental toxicity according to state or federal government labeling requirements.\nAcetazolamide appears as white to yellowish-white fine crystalline powder.

It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition.

The mechanism of action of acetazolamide is as a Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitor.\nAcetazolamide is a sulfonamide derivative with diuretic, antiglaucoma, and anticonvulsant properties. Acetazolamide is a non-competitive inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme found in cells in the proximal tube of the kidney, the eye, and glial cells. Inhibition of this enzyme in the kidney prevents excretion of hydrogen, leading to increased bicarbonate and cation excretion and increased urinary volume, which results in an alkaline diuresis. Acetazolamide reduces the concentration of bicarbonate, resulting in a decreased synthesis of aqueous humor in the eye, thereby lowering intraocular pressure. Although its mechanism of action is unknown, acetazolamide has anti-convulsant properties resulting from indirect effects secondary to metabolic acidosis or direct effects on neuronal transmission. Acetazolamide also produces respiratory stimulant effects in response to changes to both carbon dioxide and oxygen tension levels within the lungs.\nACETAZOLAMIDE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1953 and has 8 approved and 22 investigational indications.

        "text2": "Title: Monoethanolamine\nwikipedia: Ethanolamine (2-aminoethanol, monoethanolamine, ETA, or MEA) is a naturally occurring organic chemical compound with the formula HOCH2CH2NH2 or C2H7NO. The molecule is bifunctional, containing both a primary amine and a primary alcohol. Ethanolamine is a colorless, viscous liquid with an odor reminiscent of ammonia.\nEthanolamine is commonly called monoethanolamine or MEA in order to be distinguished from diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEOA). The ethanolamines comprise a group of amino alcohols. A class of antihistamines is identified as ethanolamines, which includes carbinoxamine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, chlorphenoxamine, diphenhydramine and doxylamine.\n\nHistory: Ethanolamines, or in particular, their salts, were discovered by Charles Adolphe Wurtz in 1860 by heating 2-chloroethanol with ammonia solution while studying derivatives of ethylene oxide he discovered a year earlier. He wasn't able to separate the salts or isolate any free bases.\nIn 1897 Ludwig Knorr developed the modern industrial route (see below) and separated the products, including MEA, by fractional distillation, for the first time studying their properties.\nNone of the ethanolamines were of any commercial importance until after the WWII industrial production of ethylene oxide took off.\n\nOccurrence in nature: MEA molecules are a component in the formation of cellular membranes and are thus a molecular building block for life. Ethanolamine is the second-most-abundant head group for phospholipids, substances found in biological membranes (particularly those of prokaryotes); e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine. It is also used in messenger molecules such as palmitoylethanolamide, which has an effect on CB1 receptors.\nMEA was thought to exist only on Earth and on certain asteroids, but in 2021 evidence was found that these molecules exist in interstellar space. \nEthanolamine is biosynthesized by decarboxylation of serine:\n\nHOCH2CH(CO2H)NH2 \u2192 HOCH2CH2NH2 + CO2\nDerivatives of ethanolamine are widespread in nature; e.g., lipids, as precursor of a variety of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), that modulate several animal and plant physiological processes such as seed germination, plant\u2013pathogen interactions, chloroplast development and flowering, as well as precursor, combined with arachidonic acid C20H32O2 20:4, \u03c9-6), to form the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4, \u03c9-6).\nMEA is biodegraded by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, a B12-dependent enzyme.  It is converted to acetaldehyde and ammonia via initial H-atom abstraction.\n\nH2NCH2CH2OH   \u2192   NH3  +  CH3CHO\n\nIndustrial production: Monoethanolamine is produced by treating ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia; the reaction also produces diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The ratio of the products can be controlled by the stoichiometry of the reactants.\n\nApplications: MEA is used as feedstock in the production of detergents, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and chemical intermediates.\nFor example, reacting ethanolamine with ammonia gives ethylenediamine, a precursor of the commonly used chelating agent, EDTA.\n\nGas stream scrubbing: Monoethanolamines can scrub combusted-coal, combusted-methane and combusted-biogas flue emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) very efficiently. MEA carbon dioxide scrubbing is also used to regenerate the air on submarines.\nSolutions of MEA in water are used as a gas stream scrubbing liquid in amine treaters. For example, aqueous MEA is used to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from various gas streams; e.g., flue gas and sour natural gas. The MEA ionizes dissolved acidic compounds, making them polar and considerably more soluble.\nMEA scrubbing solutions can be recycled through a regeneration unit. When heated, MEA, being a rather weak base, will release dissolved H2S or CO2 gas resulting in a pure MEA solution.\n\nOther uses: In pharmaceutical formulations, MEA is used primarily for buffering or preparation of emulsions. MEA can be used as pH regulator in cosmetics.\nIt is an injectable sclerosant as a treatment option of symptomatic hemorrhoids. 2\u20135 ml of ethanolamine oleate can be injected into the mucosa just above the hemorrhoids to cause ulceration and mucosal fixation thus preventing hemorrhoids from descending out of the anal canal.\nIt is also an ingredient in cleaning fluid for automobile windshields.\n\npH-control amine: Ethanolamine is often used for alkalinization of water in steam cycles of power plants, including nuclear power plants with pressurized water reactors. This alkalinization is performed to control corrosion of metal components. ETA (or sometimes a similar organic amine; e.g., morpholine) is selected because it does not accumulate in steam generators (boilers) and crevices due to its volatility, but rather distributes relatively uniformly throughout the entire steam cycle. In such application, ETA is a key ingredient of so-called \"all-volatile treatment\" of water (AVT).\n\nReactions: Upon reaction with carbon dioxide, 2 equivalents of ethanolamine react through the intermediacy of carbonic acid to form a carbamate salt, which when heated usually reforms back to ethanolamine and carbon dioxide but occasionally can also cyclizate to 2-oxazolidone, generating amine gas treatment wastes.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Process technology to produce ethanolamines by reaction of ammonia and ethylene oxide\nCDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards\n\n\n pubchem:\nEthanolamine appears as a clear colorless liquid with an odor resembling that of ammonia.

        "text2": "Title: Meperidine\nwikipedia: Pethidine, also known as meperidine and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a fully synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1938 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, in Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (e.g., piminodine, anileridine), the prodines (e.g., alphaprodine, MPPP), bemidones (e.g., ketobemidone), and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.\nPethidine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, and is delivered as a hydrochloride salt in tablets, as a syrup, or by intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection. For much of the 20th century, pethidine was the opioid of choice for many physicians; in 1975, 60% of doctors prescribed it for acute pain and 22% for chronic severe pain.\nIt was patented in 1937 and approved for medical use in 1943. Compared with morphine, pethidine was considered to be safer, carry a lower risk of addiction, and to be superior in treating the pain associated with biliary spasm or renal colic due to its assumed anticholinergic effects. These were later discovered to be inaccurate assumptions, as it carries an equal risk of addiction, possesses no advantageous effects on biliary spasm or renal colic compared to other opioids. Due to the neurotoxicity of its metabolite, norpethidine, it is more toxic than other opioids\u2014especially during long-term use. The norpethidine metabolite was found to have serotonergic effects, so pethidine could, unlike most opioids, increase the risk of triggering serotonin syndrome.\n\nMedical uses: Pethidine is the most widely used opioid in labour and delivery. It has fallen out of favour in some countries, such as the United States, in favour of other opioids, due to its potential drug interactions, especially with serotonergics, and its neurotoxic metabolite, norpethidine. It is still commonly used in the United Kingdom and New Zealand, and was the preferred opioid in the United Kingdom for use during labour, but has been superseded somewhat by other strong semi-synthetic opioids (e.g. hydromorphone) to avoid serotonin interactions since the mid-2000s. \nPethidine is the preferred painkiller for diverticulitis, because it decreases intestinal intraluminal pressure. Pethidine is the preferred drug for the management of shivering during therapeutic hypothermia, as it provides the greatest reduction in the shivering threshold.\nBefore 2003, it was on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system.\n\nAdverse effects: The adverse effects of pethidine administration are primarily those of the opioids as a class: nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diaphoresis, urinary retention, and constipation. Due to moderate stimulant effects mediated by pethidine's dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, sedation is less likely compared to other opioids. Unlike other opioids, it does not cause miosis because of its anticholinergic properties. Overdose can cause muscle flaccidity, respiratory depression, obtundation, psychosis, cold and clammy skin, hypotension, and coma.\nA narcotic antagonist such as naloxone is indicated to reverse respiratory depression and other effects of pethidine. Serotonin syndrome has occurred in patients receiving concurrent antidepressant therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or other medication types (see Interactions below). Convulsive seizures sometimes observed in patients receiving parenteral pethidine on a chronic basis have been attributed to accumulation in plasma of the metabolite norpethidine (normeperidine). Fatalities have occurred following either oral or intravenous pethidine overdose.\n\nInteractions: Pethidine has serious interactions that can be dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. \nSeizures may develop when tramadol is given intravenously following, or with, pethidine. It can interact as well with SSRIs and other antidepressants, antiparkinson agents, migraine therapy, stimulants and other agents causing serotonin syndrome. It is thought to be caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.\n\nMechanism of action: Like morphine, pethidine exerts its analgesic effects by acting as an agonist at the \u03bc-opioid receptor.\nPethidine is often employed in the treatment of postanesthetic shivering. The pharmacologic mechanism of this antishivering effect is not fully understood, but it may involve the stimulation of \u03ba-opioid receptors.\nPethidine has structural similarities to atropine and other tropane alkaloids and may have some of their effects and side effects. In addition to these opioidergic and anticholinergic effects, it has local anesthetic activity related to its interactions with sodium ion channels.\nPethidine's apparent in vitro efficacy as an antispasmodic agent is due to its local anesthetic effects. It does not have antispasmodic effects in vivo. Pethidine also has stimulant effects mediated by its inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). Because of its DAT inhibitory action, pethidine will substitute for cocaine in animals trained to discriminate cocaine from saline.\nSeveral analogs of pethidine such as 4-fluoropethidine have been synthesized that are potent inhibitors of the reuptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine via DAT and NET. It has also been associated with cases of serotonin syndrome, suggesting some interaction with serotonergic neurons, but the relationship has not been definitively demonstrated.\nIt is more lipid-soluble than morphine, resulting in a faster onset of action. Its duration of clinical effect is 120\u2013150 minutes, although it is typically administered at 4\u2013 to 6-hour intervals. Pethidine has been shown to be less effective than morphine, diamorphine, or hydromorphone at easing severe pain, or pain associated with movement or coughing.\nLike other opioid drugs, pethidine has the potential to cause physical dependence or addiction. The especially severe side effects unique to pethidine among opioids\u2014serotonin syndrome, seizures, delirium, dysphoria, tremor\u2014are primarily or entirely due to the action of its metabolite, norpethidine.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Pethidine is quickly hydrolysed in the liver to pethidinic acid and is also demethylated to norpethidine, which has half the analgesic activity of pethidine but a longer elimination half-life (8\u201312 hours); accumulating with regular administration, or in kidney failure. Norpethidine is toxic and has convulsant and hallucinogenic effects. \nThe toxic effects mediated by the metabolites cannot be countered with opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone, and are probably primarily due to norpethidine's anticholinergic activity probably due to its structural similarity to atropine, though its pharmacology has not been thoroughly explored. The neurotoxicity of pethidine's metabolites is a unique feature of pethidine compared to other opioids. Pethidine's metabolites are further conjugated with glucuronic acid and excreted into the urine.\n\nRecreational use: \n\nTrends: In data from the U.S. Drug Abuse Warning Network, mentions of hazardous or harmful use of pethidine declined between 1997 and 2002, in contrast to increases for fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, and oxycodone. The number of dosage units of pethidine reported lost or stolen in the U.S. increased 16.2% between 2000 and 2003, from 32,447 to 37,687.\nThis article uses the terms \"hazardous use\", \"harmful use\", and \"dependence\" in accordance with Lexicon of alcohol and drug terms, published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1994. In WHO usage, the first two terms replace the term \"abuse\" and the third term replaces the term \"addiction\".\n\nSynthesis: Pethidine can be produced in a two-step synthesis. The first step is reaction of benzyl cyanide and chlormethine in the presence of sodium amide to form a piperidine ring. The nitrile is then converted to an ester.\n\nControl: Pethidine is in Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as a Narcotic with ACSCN 9230 with a 6250 kilo aggregate manufacturing quota as of 2014. The free base conversion ratio for salts includes 0.87 for the hydrochloride and 0.84 for the hydrobromide. The A, B, and C intermediates in production of pethidine are also controlled, with ACSCN being 9232 for A (with a 6 gram quota) and 9233 being B (quota of 11 grams) and 9234 being C (6 gram quota). It is listed under the Single Convention for the Control of Narcotic Substances 1961 and is controlled in most countries in the same fashion as is morphine.\n\nSociety and culture: In John D. MacDonalds 's book \"Dress Her  in Indigo\" (1969) one of the protagonists speaks of thinking of killing an immobilized enemy of hers by injecting him with meperedine which was left over from a husband who used it while terminally ill.\nIn Raymond Chandler's novel The Long Goodbye (1953), in response to \"How is Mrs. Wade?\", police Lieutenant Bernie Ohls answers, \"Too relaxed. She must have grabbed some pills. There's a dozen kinds up there -- even demerol. That's bad stuff.\"\nHarold Shipman was addicted to pethidine at one stage, convicted of forging prescriptions to obtain it, fined \u00a3500 and briefly attended a drug rehabilitation clinic.\nDanish writer Tove Ditlevsen suffered a lifelong addiction to pethidine after her husband, a doctor, had injected her with Demerol as a painkiller for an illegal abortion in 1944.\nPethidine is referenced by its brand name Demerol in the song \"Morphine\" by singer Michael Jackson on his 1997 album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix. Pethidine was one of several prescription drugs which Michael Jackson was addicted to at the time and the singer describes this in the lyrics of the song with phrases such as \"Relax/This won't hurt you\" and \"Yesterday you had his trust/Today he's taking twice as much\".\nPethidine is referenced in the television show Broadchurch, season 2, episode 3, as it was given to the character Beth after she has her baby.\nIn the 1987 Malayalam movie, Amrutham Gamaya, Mohanlal's character, Dr. P.K. Haridas injects pethidine in himself and gets addicted to it.\nA doctor in the TV show Call the Midwife becomes addicted to pethidine.\nIn William Gibson's book Neuromancer, one of the characters say '\"A mixture of cocaine and meperidine, yes.\" The Armenian went back to the conversation he was having with the Sanyo. \"Demerol, they used to call that,\" said the Finn.'\nSouth Carolina-based modern rock group Crossfade mentions Demerol in the lyrics of their 2004 song, \"Dead Skin\".\nIn Korean drama Punch (TV series), main character Park Jung-hwan is illegally given Demerol by his doctor in exchange for legal counseling.\nIn the episode \"The Fight\" of the TV show Parks and Recreation, some characters become intoxicated on a mixed drink called Snake Juice. The character Ann (Rashida Jones), who is a nurse, asks, \"What the hell is in Snake Juice? Demerol?\"\nIn David Foster Wallace's book Infinite Jest, one of the main characters, Don Gately, is a Demerol addict in recovery.\n\nSee also: Libby Zion Law (a case involving phenelzine and pethidine)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nPethidine is a piperidinecarboxylate ester that is piperidine which is substituted by a methyl group at position 1 and by phenyl and ethoxycarbonyl groups at position 4.

It is a colorless solid.  It is used as a reagent (base) and catalyst. It can be prepared by reduction of quinuclidone and has great utility in the Cormas-Grisius Electrophilic Benzene Addition reaction. When protonated, Quinuclidine's heterocyclic structure allows its amine group to serve as a strong electrophile in the Cormas-Grisius Electrophilic Benzene Addition.\n\nStructure and chemical properties: Regarding its structure, quinuclidine is unusual in that the methylene hydrogen atoms are eclipsed within each of the three ethylene linkages.  Furthermore, the cyclohexane rings, of which there are three, adopt the boat conformations, not the usual chair conformations.\nQuinuclidine is a relatively strong organic base with pKa of the conjugate acid of 11.3. The basicity of other quinuclidines have been evaluated:\n3-hydroxy- quinuclidine (9.9), 3-acetoxyquinuclidine (9.3), 3-chloroquinuclidine (8.9), DABCO (8.7), and 3-quinuclidone (7.2).\nIt forms adducts with a variety of Lewis acids.  Because of its compact structure, quinuclidine binds to trimethylborane more tightly than does triethylamine.\n\nDerivatives and analogues: \nQuinuclidine is structurally related to DABCO, in which the other bridgehead is also nitrogen, and to tropane, which has a slightly different carbon frame.  Cinchona alkaloids, e.g. quinine, feature quinuclidine substituents.

It is also used to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. When used for local anaesthesia or in nerve blocks, lidocaine typically begins working within several minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine mixtures may also be applied directly to the skin or mucous membranes to numb the area. It is often used mixed with a small amount of adrenaline (epinephrine) to prolong its local effects and to decrease bleeding.\nIf injected intravenously, it may cause cerebral effects such as confusion, changes in vision, numbness, tingling, and vomiting. It can cause low blood pressure and an irregular heart rate. There are concerns that injecting it into a joint can cause problems with the cartilage. It appears to be generally safe for use in pregnancy. A lower dose may be required in those with liver problems. It is generally safe to use in those allergic to tetracaine or benzocaine.

In 2022, it was the 262nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nLocal numbing agent: The efficacy profile of lidocaine as a local anaesthetic is characterized by a rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has the advantage of a rapid onset of action.\nLidocaine is one of the most commonly used local anaesthetics in dentistry. It can be administered in multiple ways, most often as a nerve block or infiltration, depending on the type of treatment carried out and the area of the mouth worked on.\nFor surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures. There is tentative evidence for topical lidocaine for neuropathic pain and skin graft donor site pain. As a local numbing agent, it is used for the treatment of premature ejaculation.\nAn adhesive transdermal patch containing a 5% concentration of lidocaine in a hydrogel bandage, is approved by the US FDA for reducing nerve pain caused by shingles. The transdermal patch is also used for pain from other causes, such as compressed nerves and persistent nerve pain after some surgeries.\n\nHeart arrhythmia: Lidocaine is a common class-1b antiarrhythmic drug; it is used intravenously for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (for acute myocardial infarction, digoxin poisoning, cardioversion, or cardiac catheterization) if amiodarone is not available or contraindicated. Lidocaine should be given for this indication after defibrillation, CPR, and vasopressors have been initiated. A routine preventive dose is no longer recommended after a myocardial infarction as the overall benefit is not convincing.\n\nEpilepsy: A 2013 review on treatment for neonatal seizures recommended intravenous lidocaine as a second-line treatment, if phenobarbital fails to stop seizures.\n\nOther: Intravenous lidocaine infusions are also used to treat chronic pain and acute surgical pain as an opiate sparing technique. The quality of evidence for this use is poor so it is difficult to compare it to placebo or an epidural.\nInhaled lidocaine can be used as a cough suppressor acting peripherally to reduce the cough reflex. This application can be implemented as a safety and comfort measure for people needing intubation, as it reduces the incidence of coughing and any tracheal damage it might cause when emerging from anaesthesia.\nA 2019 systematic review of the literature found that intraurethral lidocaine reduces pain in men who undergo cystoscopic procedures. \nLidocaine, along with ethanol, ammonia, and acetic acid, may also help in treating jellyfish stings, both numbing the affected area and preventing further nematocyst discharge.\nFor gastritis, drinking a viscous lidocaine formulation may help with the pain. \nA 2021 study found that lidocaine 5% spray on glans penis 10-20 minutes prior to sexual intercourse significantly improves premature ejaculation. Another study found that lidocaine-prilocaine cream 5% is effective in premature ejaculation and 20 minutes of application time before sexual intercourse.\n\nAdverse effects: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are rare when lidocaine is used as a local anesthetic and is administered correctly. Most ADRs associated with lidocaine for anesthesia relate to administration technique (resulting in systemic exposure) or pharmacological effects of anesthesia, and allergic reactions only rarely occur. Systemic exposure to excessive quantities of lidocaine mainly results in central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular effects \u2013 CNS effects usually occur at lower blood plasma concentrations and additional cardiovascular effects present at higher concentrations, though cardiovascular collapse may also occur with low concentrations. ADRs by individual organ systems are:\n\nCNS excitation: nervousness, agitation, anxiety, apprehension, tingling around the mouth (circumoral paraesthesia), headache, hyperesthesia, tremor, dizziness, pupillary changes, psychosis, euphoria, hallucinations, and seizures\nCNS depression with increasingly heavier exposure: drowsiness, lethargy, slurred speech, hypoesthesia, confusion, disorientation, loss of consciousness, respiratory depression and apnoea.\nCardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, flushing, venous insufficiency, increased defibrillator threshold, edema, and/or cardiac arrest \u2013 some of which may be due to hypoxemia secondary to respiratory depression.\nRespiratory: bronchospasm, dyspnea, respiratory depression or arrest\nGastrointestinal: metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, agita, and diarrhea\nEars: tinnitus\nEyes: local burning, conjunctival hyperemia, corneal epithelial changes/ulceration, diplopia, visual changes (opacification)\nSkin: itching, depigmentation, rash, urticaria, edema, angioedema, bruising, inflammation of the vein at the injection site, irritation of the skin when applied topically\nBlood: methemoglobinemia\nAllergy\nADRs associated with the use of intravenous lidocaine are similar to the toxic effects of systemic exposure above. These are dose-related and more frequent at high infusion rates (\u22653 mg/min). Common ADRs include headache, dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, visual disturbances, tinnitus, tremor, and/or paraesthesia. Infrequent ADRs associated with the use of lidocaine include: hypotension, bradycardia, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, muscle twitching, seizures, coma, and/or respiratory depression.\nIt is generally safe to use lidocaine with vasoconstrictors such as adrenaline, including in regions such as the nose, ears, fingers, and toes. While concerns of tissue death, if used in these areas, have been raised, the evidence does not support these concerns.\nThe use of lidocaine for spinal anesthesia may lead to an increased risk of transient neurological symptoms, a painful condition that is sometimes experienced immediately after surgery. There is some weak evidence to suggest that the use of alternative anesthetic medications such as prilocaine, procaine, bupivacaine, ropivacaine, or levobupivacaine may decrease the risk of a person developing transient neurological symptoms. Low-quality evidence suggests that 2\u2010chloroprocaine and mepivacaine when used for spinal anesthetic have a similar risk of the person developing transient neurological symptoms as lidocaine.\n\nInteractions: Any drugs that are also ligands of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 can potentially increase serum levels and potential for toxicity or decrease serum levels and the efficacy, depending on whether they induce or inhibit the enzymes, respectively. Drugs that may increase the chance of methemoglobinemia should also be considered carefully. Dronedarone and liposomal morphine are both absolutely a contraindication, as they may increase the serum levels, but hundreds of other drugs require monitoring for interaction.\n\nContraindications: Absolute contraindications for the use of lidocaine include:\n\nHeart block, second or third degree (without pacemaker)\nSevere sinoatrial block (without pacemaker)\nSerious adverse drug reaction to lidocaine or amide local anesthetics\nHypersensitivity to corn and corn-related products (corn-derived dextrose is used in the mixed injections)\nConcurrent treatment with quinidine, flecainide, disopyramide, procainamide (class I antiarrhythmic agents)\nPrior use of amiodarone hydrochloride\nAdams\u2013Stokes syndrome\nWolff\u2013Parkinson\u2013White syndrome\nLidocaine viscous is not recommended by the FDA to treat teething pain in children and infants.\nExercise caution in people with any of these:\n\nHypotension not due to arrhythmia\nBradycardia\nAccelerated idioventricular rhythm\nElderly\nEhlers\u2013Danlos syndromes; efficiency of local anesthetics can be reduced\nPseudocholinesterase deficiency\nIntra-articular infusion (this is not an approved indication and can cause chondrolysis)\nPorphyria, especially acute intermittent porphyria; lidocaine has been classified as porphyrogenic because of the hepatic enzymes it induces, although clinical evidence suggests it is not. Bupivacaine is a safe alternative in this case.\nImpaired liver function \u2013 people with lowered hepatic function may have an adverse reaction with repeated administration of lidocaine because the drug is metabolized by the liver. Adverse reactions may include neurological symptoms (e.g. dizziness, nausea, muscle twitches, vomiting, or seizures).\n\nOverdosage: Overdoses of lidocaine may result from excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children (who are more susceptible to overdose), accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or from prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgery. The maximum safe dose is 3 mg per kg.\nSuch overdoses have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults (local anesthetic systemic toxicity). Symptoms include central nervous system manifestations such as numbness of the tongue, dizziness, tinnitus, visual disturbances, convulsions, reduced consciousness progressing to coma, as well as respiratory arrest and cardiovascular disturbances. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. \nLidocaine is often given intravenously as an antiarrhythmic agent in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parenteral feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more common.\n\nPostarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis: Lidocaine in large amounts may be toxic to cartilage and intra-articular infusions can lead to postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nMechanism of action: Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by prolonging the inactivation of the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane responsible for action potential propagation. With sufficient blockage, the voltage-gated sodium channels will not open and an action potential will not be generated. Careful titration allows for a high degree of selectivity in the blockage of sensory neurons, whereas higher concentrations also affect other types of neurons.\nThe same principle applies to this drug's actions in the heart. Blocking sodium channels in the conduction system, as well as the muscle cells of the heart, raises the depolarization threshold, making the heart less likely to initiate or conduct early action potentials that may cause an arrhythmia.\n\nPharmacokinetics: When used as an injectable it typically begins working within four minutes and lasts for half an hour to three hours. Lidocaine is about 95% metabolized (dealkylated) in the liver mainly by CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and then subsequently to the inactive glycine xylidide. MEGX has a longer half-life than lidocaine, but also is a less potent sodium channel blocker. The volume of distribution is 1.1 L/kg to 2.1 L/kg, but congestive heart failure can decrease it. About 60% to 80% circulates bound to the protein alpha1 acid glycoprotein. The oral bioavailability is 35% and the topical bioavailability is 3%. Lidocaine efficacy may be reduced in tissues that are inflamed, due to competing inflammatory mediators.\nThe elimination half-life of lidocaine is biphasic and around 90 min to 120 min in most people. This may be prolonged in people with hepatic impairment (average 343 min) or congestive heart failure (average 136 min). Lidocaine is excreted in the urine (90% as metabolites and 10% as unchanged drug).\n\nChemistry: \n\nMolecular structure and conformational flexibility: Lidocaine's 1,5-dimethylbenzene group gives it hydrophobic properties. In addition to this aromatic unit, lidocaine has an aliphatic section comprising amide, carbonyl, and enyl groups.\nLidocaine exhibits a remarkable degree of conformational flexibility, resulting in more than 60 probable conformers. This adaptability arises from the high lability of the amide and ethyl groups within the molecule. These groups can undergo shifts in their positions, leading to significant variations in the overall molecular configuration.\n\nInfluence of temperature and pressure on conformational preference: The dynamic transformation of lidocaine conformers in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) highly depends on external factors such as pressure and temperature. Alterations in these conditions can lead to distinct conformations, impacting the molecule's physicochemical properties. One notable consequence of these variations is the particle size of lidocaine when produced through micronization using scCO2. Changes in the position of the amide group within the molecule can trigger a redistribution of intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, affecting the outcome of the micronization process and the resultant particle size.\n\nVeterinary use: Lidocaine is commonly used in veterinary medicine in both companion and production animals around the world and is listed as an essential veterinary medicine by the World Veterinary Association and also the World Small Animal Veterinary Association.[1]  \nIn veterinary medicine, it is commonly used as a local anaesthetic both as an injectable or topical product. It provides excellent local anaesthesia when given by local infiltration into a tissue or via specific nerve blocks. These are commonly applied to nerves of the head, limbs, thorax, and spine. It can also be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias when given intravenously. In most veterinary species, when given via injection, it has a rapid onset of action (2-10 minutes) with a duration of action of 30-60 minutes. \nIn veterinary species, its metabolism is much the same as humans with rapid metabolism in the liver to the major metabolites MEGX (monoethylglycine xylidide) and GX (glycine xylidide) that retain partial activity against sodium channels. These compounds are further metabolized to monoethylglycine and xylidide, respectively.\nToxicity in animals is similar to that seen in humans with both toxicity to the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system observed. General the CNS signs are seen first with agitation and muscle twitching seen before the cardiovascular signs of hypotension, myocardial depression, and arrhythmias. Further CNS depression will result from higher doses with seizures and convulsions and eventually apnea and death.\nIt is a component of the veterinary drug Tributame along with embutramide and chloroquine used to carry out euthanasia on horses and dogs.\n\nHistory: Lidocaine, the first amino amide\u2013type local anesthetic (previous were amino esters), was first synthesized under the name 'xylocaine' by Swedish chemist Nils L\u00f6fgren in 1943. His colleague Bengt Lundqvist performed the first injection anesthesia experiments on himself. It was first marketed in 1949.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nDosage forms: Lidocaine, usually in the form of its hydrochloride salt, is available in various forms including many topical formulations and solutions for injection or infusion.  It is also available as a transdermal patch, which is applied directly to the skin.\n\nNames: Lidocaine is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN), British Approved Name (BAN), and Australian Approved Name (AAN), while lignocaine is the former BAN and AAN. Both the old and new names will be displayed on the product label in Australia until at least 2023.\nXylocaine is a brand name, referring to the major synthetic building block 2,6-xylidine. The \"ligno\" prefix is chosen because \"xylo\" means wood in Greek while \"ligno\" means the same in Latin. The \"lido\" prefix instead refers to the fact that the drug is chemically related to acetanilide.\n\nRecreational use: As of 2021, lidocaine is not listed by the World Anti-Doping Agency as a substance whose use is banned in sport. It is used as an adjuvant, adulterant, and diluent to street drugs such as cocaine and heroin. It is one of the three common ingredients in site enhancement oil used by bodybuilders.\n\nAdulterant in cocaine: Lidocaine is often added to cocaine as a diluent. Cocaine and lidocaine both numb the gums when applied. This gives the user the impression of high-quality cocaine when in actuality the user is receiving a diluted product.\n\nCompendial status: Japanese Pharmacopoeia 15\nUnited States Pharmacopeia 31\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \"Lidocaine Transdermal Patch\". MedlinePlus.\nUS patent 2441498, Nils Magnus Loefgren & Bengt Josef Lundqvist, \"Alkyl glycinanilides\", published 1948-05-11, issued 1948-05-11,  assigned to ASTRA APOTEKARNES KEM FAB\n\n\n pubchem:\nLidocaine is the monocarboxylic acid amide resulting from the formal condensation of N,N-diethylglycine with 2,6-dimethylaniline. It has a role as a local anaesthetic, an anti-arrhythmia drug, an environmental contaminant, a xenobiotic and a drug allergen. It is a monocarboxylic acid amide, a tertiary amino compound and a member of benzenes. It is functionally related to a glycinamide.\nEver since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation.  Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\nLidocaine is an Amide Local Anesthetic and Antiarrhythmic. The physiologic effect of lidocaine is by means of Local Anesthesia.\nLidocaine is a synthetic aminoethylamide with local anesthetic and antiarrhythmic properties. Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by binding to and inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thereby inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses and effecting local anesthesia.\nLIDOCAINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1948 and has 23 approved and 105 investigational indications. This drug has a black box warning from the FDA.\nLidocaine is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is a local anesthetic and cardiac depressant used as an antiarrhythmia agent. Its actions are more intense and its effects more prolonged than those of procaine but its duration of action is shorter than that of bupivacaine or prilocaine. Lidocaine stabilizes the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses thereby effecting local anesthetic action. Lidocaine alters signal conduction in neurons by blocking the fast voltage gated sodium (Na+) channels in the neuronal cell membrane that are responsible for signal propagation. With sufficient blockage the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential. This creates the anaesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their birth in the first place.\nA local anesthetic and cardiac depressant used as an antiarrhythmia agent.

It does this by prolonging the inactivation of the fast voltage-gated Na+ channels in the neuronal cell membrane, which are responsible for action potential propagation. When these sodium channels are sufficiently blocked, they will not open, and an action potential will not be generated, leading to the failure of the postsynaptic neuron membrane to depolarize and thus preventing the transmission of an action potential.

The pure compound is pale yellow, but commercial samples are often colored. It is barely soluble in water and is often supplied as a wet paste. It is widely used in the production of diarylide yellow pigments used in the production of printing inks. Its use in the production of dyes has been largely discontinued because of concerns about carcinogenicity.\n\nPreparation and reactions: 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is prepared in two steps from 2-nitrochlorobenzene. The first step involves reduction with zinc in base to afford 2,2'-dichlorodiphenylhydrazine.  This intermediate undergoes the benzidine rearrangement to afford 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine.\nAqueous solutions of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine degrade in light to monochloro derivative. It undergoes chlorination (for example in water treatment plants) to give the tetrachloro derivative.\nThe most widely practiced reaction of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine is its double diazotization. This bis(diazo) intermediate is then coupled to derivatives of acetoacetylaminobenzene (CH3C(O)CH2C(O)NHAr).  In this way, the following commercial yellow pigments are produced: pigment Yellow 12, pigment Yellow 13, pigment Yellow 14, pigment Yellow 17 and pigment Yellow 83.\n\nSafety: 3,3'-Dichlorobenzidine is considered a carcinogen.

        "text2": "Title: Benzidine\nwikipedia: Benzidine (trivial name), also called 1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine (systematic name), is an organic compound with the formula (C6H4NH2)2.   It is an aromatic amine.  It is a component of a test for cyanide.  Related derivatives are used in the production of dyes. Benzidine has been linked to bladder and pancreatic cancer.\n\nSynthesis and properties: Benzidine is prepared in a two step process from nitrobenzene.  First, the nitrobenzene is converted to 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, usually using iron powder as the reducing agent.  Treatment of this hydrazine with mineral acids induces a rearrangement reaction to 4,4'-benzidine.  Smaller amounts of other isomers are also formed.  The benzidine rearrangement, which proceeds intramolecularly, is a classic mechanistic puzzle in organic chemistry.\n\nThe conversion is described as a [5,5]sigmatropic reaction.\n\nIn terms of its physical properties, 4,4'-benzidine is poorly soluble in cold water but can be recrystallized from hot water, where it crystallises as the monohydrate.  It is dibasic, the deprotonated species has Ka values of 9.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 and 5.6 \u00d7 10\u221211.  Its solutions react with oxidizing agents to give deeply coloured quinone-related derivatives.\n\nApplications: Conversion of benzidine to the bis(diazonium) salt was once an integral step in the preparation of direct dyes (requiring no mordant).  Treatment of this bis(diazonium) salt with 1-aminonaphthalene-4-sulfonic acid gives the once popular congo red dye.  In the past, benzidine was used to test for blood. An enzyme in blood causes the oxidation of benzidine to a distinctively blue-coloured derivative. The test for cyanide relies on similar reactivity. Such applications have largely been replaced by methods using phenolphthalein/hydrogen peroxide and luminol.\n\nRelated 4,4\u2019-benzidines: A variety of derivatives of 4,4\u2019-benzidine are commercially produced on the scale of one to a few thousand kilograms per year, mainly as precursors to dyes and pigments.

        "text1": "Title: Buspirone\nwikipedia: Buspirone, sold under the brand name Buspar, among others, is an anxiolytic, a medication primarily used to treat anxiety disorders, particularly generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, increasing action at serotonin receptors in the brain. It is taken orally and takes two to six weeks to be fully effective.\nCommon side effects of buspirone include nausea, headaches, dizziness, and difficulty concentrating. Serious side effects may include movement disorders, serotonin syndrome, and seizures. Its use in pregnancy appears to be safe but has not been well studied, and use during breastfeeding has not been well studied.\nBuspirone was developed in 1968 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1986. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 54th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12 million prescriptions.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nAnxiety: Buspirone is used for the short-term and long-term treatment of anxiety disorders or symptoms of anxiety. It is generally preferred over benzodiazepines because it does not activate the receptors that make drugs like alprazolam addictive.\nBuspirone has no immediate anxiolytic effects, and hence has a delayed onset of action; its full clinical effectiveness may require 2\u20134 weeks to manifest itself. The drug is similarly effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to benzodiazepines including diazepam, alprazolam, lorazepam, and clorazepate. Buspirone is not known to be effective in the treatment of other anxiety disorders besides GAD.\n\nOther uses: \n\nSexual dysfunction: There is some evidence that buspirone on its own may be useful in the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in women. Buspirone may also be effective in treating antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction.\n\nMiscellaneous: Buspirone is not effective as a treatment for benzodiazepine withdrawal, barbiturate withdrawal, or alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens.\nSSRI and SNRI antidepressants such as paroxetine and venlafaxine may cause jaw pain/jaw spasm reversible syndrome (although it is not common), and buspirone appears to be successful in treating bruxism on SSRI/SNRI-induced jaw clenching.\n\nContraindications: Buspirone has these contraindications:\n\nHypersensitivity to buspirone\nMetabolic acidosis, as in diabetes\nShould not be used with MAO inhibitors\nSeverely compromised liver and/or kidney function\n\nSide effects: Known side effects associated with buspirone include dizziness, headaches, nausea, tinnitus, and paresthesia. Buspirone is relatively well tolerated and is not associated with sedation, cognitive and psychomotor impairment, muscle relaxation, physical dependence, or anticonvulsant effects. In addition, buspirone does not produce euphoria and is not a drug of abuse.\n\nOverdose: Buspirone appears to be relatively benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone was administered to healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375 mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400 mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250 mg and up to 300 mg buspirone have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death has been reported in a co-ingestion of 450 mg buspirone with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, and cocaine.\n\nInteractions: Buspirone has been shown in vitro to be metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4. This finding is consistent with the in vivo interactions observed between buspirone and these inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), among others:\n\nItraconazole: Increased plasma level of buspirone\nRifampicin: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone\nNefazodone: Increased plasma levels of buspirone\nHaloperidol: Increased plasma levels of buspirone\nCarbamazepine: Decreased plasma levels of buspirone\nGrapefruit: Significantly increases the plasma levels of buspirone. See grapefruit\u2013drug interactions.\nFluvoxamine: Moderately increased plasma levels of buspirone.\nElevated blood pressure has been reported when buspirone has been administered to patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Buspirone acts as a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor with high affinity. It is a partial agonist of both presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, which are inhibitory autoreceptors, and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. It is thought that the main effects of buspirone are mediated via its interaction with the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor, thus reducing the firing of serotonin-producing neurons. Buspirone also seems to have lower affinities for the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 receptors where it probably acts as an antagonist.\nIn addition to binding to serotonin receptors, buspirone is an antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor with weak affinity. It preferentially blocks inhibitory presynaptic D2 autoreceptors, and antagonizes postsynaptic D2 receptors only at higher doses. In accordance, buspirone has been found to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal pathway at low doses, whereas at higher doses, postsynaptic D2 receptors are blocked and antidopaminergic effects such as hypoactivity and reduced stereotypy, though notably not catalepsy, are observed in animals. Buspirone has also been found to bind with much higher affinity to the dopamine D3 and D4 receptors, where it is similarly an antagonist.\nA major metabolite of buspirone, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), occurs at higher circulating levels than buspirone itself and is known to act as a potent \u03b12-adrenergic receptor antagonist. This metabolite may be responsible for the increased noradrenergic and dopaminergic activity observed with buspirone in animals. Buspirone also has very weak and probably clinically unimportant affinity for the \u03b11-adrenergic receptor. However, buspirone has been reported to have shown \"significant and selective intrinsic efficacy\" at the \u03b11-adrenergic receptor expressed in a \"tissue- and species-dependent manner\".\nUnlike benzodiazepines, buspirone does not interact with the GABAA receptor complex.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Buspirone has a low oral bioavailability of 3.9% relative to intravenous injection due to extensive first-pass metabolism. The time to peak plasma levels following ingestion is 0.9 to 1.5 hours. It is reported to have an elimination half-life of 2.8 hours, although a review of 14 studies found that the mean terminal half-life ranged between 2 and 11 hours, and one study even reported a terminal half-life of 33 hours. Buspirone is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4, and prominent drug interactions with inhibitors and inducers of this enzyme have been observed. Major metabolites of buspirone include 5-hydroxybuspirone, 6-hydroxybuspirone, 8-hydroxybuspirone, and 1-PP. 6-Hydroxybuspirone has been identified as the predominant hepatic metabolite of buspirone, with plasma levels that are 40-fold greater than those of buspirone after oral administration of buspirone to humans. The metabolite is a high-affinity partial agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki=25 nM) similarly to buspirone, and has demonstrated occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor in vivo. As such, it is likely to play an important role in the therapeutic effects of buspirone. 1-PP has also been found to circulate at higher levels than those of buspirone itself and may similarly play a significant role in the clinical effects of buspirone.\n\nChemistry: Buspirone is a member of the azapirone chemical class, and consists of azaspirodecanedione and pyrimidinylpiperazine components linked together by a butyl chain.\n\nAnalogues: Structural analogues of buspirone include other azapirones like gepirone, ipsapirone, perospirone, and tandospirone.\nA number of analogues are recorded.\n\nSynthesis: A number of methods of synthesis have also been reported.  One method begins with alkylation of 1-(2-pyrimidyl)piperazine (1) with 3-chloro-1-cyanopropane (4-chlorobutyronitrile) (2) to give (3). Next, reduction of the nitrile group is performed either by catalytic hydrogenation or with lithium aluminium hydride (LAH) giving (4). The primary amine is then reacted with 3,3-tetramethyleneglutaric anhydride (5) in order to yield buspirone (6).\n\nHistory: Buspirone was first synthesized by a team at Mead Johnson in 1968 but was not patented until 1980. It was initially developed as an antipsychotic acting on the D2 receptor but was found to be ineffective in the treatment of psychosis; it was then used as an anxiolytic instead. In 1986, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained FDA approval for buspirone in the treatment of GAD. The patent expired in 2001, and buspirone is now available as a generic drug.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nGeneric names: Buspirone is the INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip D\u00e9nomination Commune Fran\u00e7aise, and DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana of buspirone, while buspirone hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name.\n\nBrand names: Buspirone was primarily sold under the brand name Buspar. Buspar is currently listed as discontinued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In 2010, in response to a citizen petition, the FDA determined that Buspar was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links:  Media related to Buspirone at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n pubchem:\nBuspirone is an azaspiro compound that is 8-azaspiro[4.5]decane-7,9-dione substituted at the nitrogen atom by a 4-(piperazin-1-yl)butyl group which in turn is substituted by a pyrimidin-2-yl group at the N(4) position. It has a role as an anxiolytic drug, a sedative, a serotonergic agonist and an EC 3.4.21.26 (prolyl oligopeptidase) inhibitor. It is an azaspiro compound, a member of pyrimidines, a N-arylpiperazine, a N-alkylpiperazine, a member of piperidones and an organic heteropolycyclic compound. It is a conjugate base of a buspirone(1+).\nBuspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class, buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs. Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'. First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975, it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar\u00ae. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate. The potential use of buspirone in combination with [melatonin] in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.\nBuspirone is a psychoactive drug used for management of general anxiety disorders and alleviation of the symptoms of anxiety. Despite wide scale use, it is an infrequent cause of serum enzyme elevations and has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.\nBuspirone is an anxiolytic agent chemically and pharmacologically unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other sedative/hypnotic drugs.  Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, buspirone may exert its anti-anxiety effects via serotonin (5-HT1A) and dopamine receptors (D2) and may indirectly affect other neurotransmitter systems. Unlike typical benzodiazepine anxiolytics, this agent does not exert anticonvulsant or muscle relaxant effects and lacks prominent sedative effects.\nBUSPIRONE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1986 and has 4 approved and 19 investigational indications.\nBuspirone is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is an anxiolytic agent and a serotonin receptor agonist belonging to the azaspirodecanedione class of compounds. Its structure is unrelated to those of the benzodiazepines, but it has an efficacy comparable to diazepam. Buspirone binds to 5-HT type 1A serotonin receptors on presynaptic neurons in the dorsal raphe and on postsynaptic neurons in the hippocampus, thus inhibiting the firing rate of 5-HT-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe. Buspirone also binds at dopamine type 2 (DA2) receptors, blocking presynaptic dopamine receptors. Buspirone increases firing in the locus ceruleus, an area of brain where norepinephrine cell bodies are found in high concentration. The net result of buspirone actions is that serotonergic activity is suppressed while noradrenergic and dopaminergic cell firing is enhanced.\nAn anxiolytic agent and serotonin receptor agonist belonging to the azaspirodecanedione class of compounds.

        "text2": "Title: Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride\nwikipedia: Chlordiazepoxide, trade name Librium among others, is a sedative and hypnotic medication of the benzodiazepine class; it is used to treat anxiety, insomnia and symptoms of withdrawal from alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other drugs.\nChlordiazepoxide has a medium to long half-life but its active metabolite has a very long half-life. The drug has amnesic, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, hypnotic, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties.\nChlordiazepoxide was patented in 1958 and approved for medical use in 1960. It was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized and the discovery of chlordiazepoxide was by pure chance. Chlordiazepoxide and other benzodiazepines were initially accepted with widespread public approval but were followed with widespread public disapproval and recommendations for more restrictive medical guidelines for its use.\n\nMedical uses: Chlordiazepoxide is indicated for the short-term (2\u20134 weeks) treatment of anxiety that is severe and disabling or subjecting the person to unacceptable distress. It is also indicated as a treatment for the management of acute  alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\nIt can sometimes be prescribed to ease symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome combined with clidinium bromide as a fixed dose medication, Librax.\n\nContraindications: Use of chlordiazepoxide should be avoided in individuals with the following conditions:\n\nMyasthenia gravis\nAcute intoxication with alcohol, narcotics, or other psychoactive substances\nAtaxia\nSevere hypoventilation\nAcute narrow-angle glaucoma\nSevere liver deficiencies (hepatitis and liver cirrhosis decrease elimination by a factor of 2)\nSevere sleep apnea\nHypersensitivity or allergy to any drug in the benzodiazepine class\nChlordiazepoxide is generally considered an inappropriate benzodiazepine for the elderly due to its long elimination half-life and the risks of accumulation. Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, pregnancy, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.\n\nPregnancy: The research into the safety of benzodiazepines during pregnancy is limited and it is recommended that use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy should be based on whether the benefits outweigh the risks. If chlordiazepoxide is used during pregnancy the risks can be reduced via using the lowest effective dose and for the shortest time possible. Benzodiazepines should generally be avoided during the first trimester of pregnancy. Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are considered to be among the safer benzodiazepines to use during pregnancy in comparison to other benzodiazepines. Possible adverse effects from benzodiazepine use during pregnancy include, miscarriage, malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, functional deficits, carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. Caution is also advised during breast feeding as chlordiazepoxide passes into breast milk.\n\nAdverse effects: Sedative drugs and sleeping pills, including chlordiazepoxide, have been associated with an increased risk of death. The studies had many limitations, such as possible tendency to overestimate risk, possible confounding by indication with other risk factors and confusing hypnotics with drugs having other indications.\nCommon side-effects of chlordiazepoxide include:\n\nConfusion\nConstipation\nDrowsiness\nFainting\nAltered sex drive\nLiver problems\nLack of muscle coordination\nMinor menstrual irregularities\nNausea\nSkin rash or eruptions\nSwelling due to fluid retention\nYellow eyes and skin\nChlordiazepoxide in laboratory mice studies impairs latent learning. Benzodiazepines impair learning and memory via their action on benzodiazepine receptors, which causes a dysfunction in the cholinergic neuronal system in mice. It was later found that impairment in learning was caused by an increase in benzodiazepine/GABA activity (and that benzodiazepines were not associated with the cholinergic system). In tests of various benzodiazepine compounds, chlordiazepoxide was found to cause the most profound reduction in the turnover of 5HT (serotonin) in rats. Serotonin is closely involved in regulating mood and may be one of the causes of feelings of depression in rats using chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines.\n\nIn September 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the boxed warning for all benzodiazepine medicines to be updated to describe the risks of abuse, misuse, addiction, physical dependence, and withdrawal reactions consistently across all the medicines in the class.\n\nTolerance and dependence: \n\nTolerance: Chronic use of benzodiazepines, such as chlordiazepoxide, leads to the development of tolerance, with a decrease in number of benzodiazepine binding sites in mice forebrains. The Committee of Review of Medicines, who carried out an extensive review of benzodiazepines including chlordiazepoxide, found\u2014and were in agreement with the US Institute of Medicine and the conclusions of a study carried out by the White House Office of Drug Policy and the US National Institute on Drug Abuse\u2014that there was little evidence that long-term use of benzodiazepines was beneficial in the treatment of insomnia due to the development of tolerance. Benzodiazepines tended to lose their sleep-promoting properties within 3 to 14 days of continuous use, and in the treatment of anxiety the committee found that there was little convincing evidence that benzodiazepines retained efficacy in the treatment of anxiety after four months' continuous use due to the development of tolerance.\n\nDependence: Chlordiazepoxide can cause physical dependence and what is known as the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from chlordiazepoxide or other benzodiazepines often leads to withdrawal symptoms that are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can, however, occur at standard dosages and also after short-term use. Benzodiazepine treatment should be discontinued as soon as possible through a slow and gradual dose-reduction regime.\nChlordiazepoxide taken during pregnancy can cause a postnatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.\n\nOverdose: An individual who has consumed excess chlordiazepoxide may display some of the following symptoms:\n\nSomnolence (difficulty staying awake)\nMental confusion\nHypotension\nHypoventilation\nImpaired motor functions\nImpaired reflexes\nImpaired coordination\nImpaired balance\nDizziness\nMuscle weakness\nComa\nChlordiazepoxide is typically used under controlled conditions for specific syndromes and sees far less frequent usage when compared to newer drugs of the same class and thus is unlikely to be encountered in a clinical emergency setting as a stand-alone drug causing life-threatening concern. Like other drugs in its class, chlordiazepoxide alongside benzodiazepines as a whole have a lowered potential to cause life-threatening injury - though this does not preclude their common co-contaminant discovery with other depressant drugs of abuse, nor their ability to contribute to an already potentially fatal episode of drug-induced respiratory depression. In cases of suspected overdose, supportive care and observation are most often indicated and provided incrementally in relation to severity and duration of symptoms. Flumazenil is uniquely poised as an \"antidote\" that specifically counteracts damaging central nervous system affect induced via benzodiazepine mechanism of action - though is not generally indicated in relation to the severity of symptoms where other treatment options exist, and often has numerous damaging consequences that must be carefully weighted before any potential administration.\n\nPharmacology: Chlordiazepoxide acts on benzodiazepine allosteric sites that are part of the  GABAA receptor/ion-channel complex and this results in an increased binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the GABAA receptor thereby producing inhibitory effects on the central nervous system and body similar to the effects of other benzodiazepines. Chlordiazepoxide is an anticonvulsant.\nChlordiazepoxide is preferentially stored in some organs including the hearts of neonates. Absorption by any administered route and the risk of accumulation is significantly higher in neonates. The withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide during pregnancy and breast feeding is recommended, as chlordiazepoxide rapidly crosses the placenta and also is excreted in breast milk.  Chlordiazepoxide also decreases prolactin release in rats. Benzodiazepines act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive Calcium uptake in animal nerve terminal preparations. Chlordiazepoxide inhibits acetylcholine release in mouse hippocampal synaptosomes in vivo. This has been found by measuring sodium-dependent high affinity choline uptake in vitro after pretreatment of the mice in vivo with chlordiazepoxide. This may play a role in chlordiazepoxide's anticonvulsant properties.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Chlordiazepoxide is a long-acting benzodiazepine drug. The half-life of chlordiazepoxide is from 5 to 30 hours but has an active benzodiazepine metabolite, nordiazepam, which has a half-life of 36 to 200 hours. The half-life of chlordiazepoxide increases significantly in the elderly, which may result in prolonged action as well as accumulation of the drug during repeated administration. Delayed body clearance of the long half-life active metabolite also occurs in those over 60 years of age, which further prolongs the effects of the drugs with additional accumulation after repeated dosing.\nDespite its name, chlordiazepoxide is not an epoxide.\n\nHistory: Chlordiazepoxide (initially called methaminodiazepoxide) was the first benzodiazepine to be synthesized in the mid-1950s. The synthesis was derived from work on a class of dyes, quinazoline-3-oxides. It was discovered by accident when in 1957 tests revealed that the compound had hypnotic, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects. \"The story of the chemical development of Librium and Valium was told by Sternbach. The serendipity involved in the invention of this class of compounds was matched by the trials and errors of the pharmacologists in the discovery of the tranquilizing activity of the benzodiazepines. The discovery of Librium in 1957 was due largely to the dedicated work and observational ability of a gifted technician, Beryl Kappell. For some seven years she had been screening compounds by simple animal tests for muscle relaxant activity using myanesin as a standard and then meprobamate and chlorpromazine when they became available. All compounds submitted by the chemical staff for central nervous activity were screened. It was this battery of tests that picked out RO 5-0690 (Librium, chlordiazepoxide) as being similar but more potent than meprobamate.\" Three years later chlordiazepoxide was marketed as a therapeutic benzodiazepine medication under the brand name Librium. Following chlordiazepoxide, in 1963 diazepam hit the market under the brand name Valium\u2014and was followed by many further benzodiazepine compounds over the subsequent years and decades.\nIn 1959 it was used by over 2,000 physicians and more than 20,000 patients. It was described as \"chemically and clinically different from any of the tranquilizers, psychic energizers or other psychotherapeutic drugs now available.\" During studies, chlordiazepoxide induced muscle relaxation and a quieting effect on laboratory animals like mice, rats, cats, and dogs. Fear and aggression were eliminated in much smaller doses than those necessary to produce hypnosis. Chlordiazepoxide is similar to phenobarbital in its anticonvulsant properties. However, it lacks the hypnotic effects of barbiturates. Animal tests were conducted in the Boston Zoo and the San Diego Zoo. Forty-two hospital patients admitted for acute and chronic alcoholism, and various psychoses and neuroses were treated with chlordiazepoxide. In a majority of the patients, anxiety, tension, and motor excitement were \"effectively reduced.\" The most positive results were observed among alcoholic patients. It was reported that ulcers and dermatologic problems, both of which involved emotional factors, were reduced by chlordiazepoxide.\nIn 1963, approval for use was given to diazepam (Valium), a \"simplified\" version of chlordiazepoxide, primarily to counteract anxiety symptoms. Sleep-related problems were treated with nitrazepam (Mogadon), which was introduced in 1972, temazepam (Restoril), which was introduced in 1979, and flurazepam (Dalmane), which was introduced in 1975.\n\nRecreational use: In 1963, Carl F. Essig of the Addiction Research Center of the National Institute of Mental Health stated that meprobamate, glutethimide, ethinamate, ethchlorvynol, methyprylon and chlordiazepoxide were drugs whose usefulness \u201ccan hardly be questioned.\u201d However, Essig labeled these \u201cnewer products\u201d as \u201cdrugs of addiction,\u201d like barbiturates, whose habit-forming qualities were more widely known. He mentioned a 90-day study of chlordiazepoxide, which concluded that the automobile accident rate among 68 users was 10 times higher than normal. Participants' daily dosage ranged from 5 to 100 milligrams.\nChlordiazepoxide is a drug of potential misuse and is frequently detected in urine samples of drug users who have not been prescribed the drug.\n\nLegal status: Internationally, chlordiazepoxide is a Schedule IV controlled drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.\n\nToxicity: \n\nAnimal: Laboratory tests assessing the toxicity of chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam and diazepam on mice spermatozoa found that chlordiazepoxide produced toxicities in sperm including abnormalities involving both the shape and size of the sperm head. Nitrazepam, however, caused more profound abnormalities than chlordiazepoxide.\n\nAvailability: Chlordiazepoxide is available in various dosage forms, alone or in combination with other drugs, worldwide. In combination with Clidinium as NORMAXIN-CC and in combination with dicyclomine as NORMAXIN for IBS, and with the anti-depressant amitriptyline as Limbitrol.\n\nSee also: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome\nBenzodiazepine\nBenzodiazepine dependence\nBenzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome\nEffects of long-term benzodiazepine use\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Rx-List.com - Chlordiazepoxide\nInchem.org - Chlordiazepoxide\nU.S. National Library of Medicine: Drug Information Portal - Chlordiazepoxide\n\n\n pubchem:\nChlordiazepoxide Hydrochloride can cause developmental toxicity according to state or federal government labeling requirements.\nCHLORDIAZEPOXIDE HYDROCHLORIDE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV that was first approved in 1960.

It is also a steroid that blocks the effects of the hormones aldosterone and, to a lesser degree, testosterone, causing some estrogen-like effects. Spironolactone belongs to a class of medications known as potassium-sparing diuretics.\nSpironolactone was discovered in 1957, and was introduced in 1959. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 52nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 12 million prescriptions. Spironolactone has a history of use in the trans community. Its use continues despite the rise of various accessible alternatives such as bicalutamide and cyproterone acetate with more precise action and less side effects.\n\nMedical uses: Spironolactone is used primarily to treat heart failure, edematous conditions such as nephrotic syndrome or ascites in people with liver disease, essential hypertension, low blood levels of potassium, secondary hyperaldosteronism (such as occurs with liver cirrhosis), and Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism). The most common use of spironolactone is in the treatment of heart failure. On its own, spironolactone is only a weak diuretic because it primarily targets the distal nephron (collecting tubule), where only small amounts of sodium are reabsorbed, but it can be combined with other diuretics to increase efficacy. The classification of spironolactone as a \"potassium-sparing diuretic\" has been described as obsolete. Spironolactone is also used to treat Bartter's syndrome due to its ability to raise potassium levels.\nSpironolactone has antiandrogenic activity. For this reason, it is used to treat a variety of dermatological conditions in which androgens play a role. Some of these uses include acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss in women. Spironolactone is used for the treatment of hirsutism in the United States. High doses of spironolactone, which are needed for considerable antiandrogenic effects, are not recommended for men due to the high risk of feminization and other side effects. Spironolactone can be used to treat symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as due to polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nHeart failure: While loop diuretics remain first-line for most people with heart failure, spironolactone has been shown to reduce both morbidity and mortality in numerous studies and remains an important agent for treating fluid retention, edema, and symptoms of heart failure. Current recommendations from the American Heart Association are to use spironolactone in patients with NYHA Class II-IV heart failure who have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 35%.\nSpironolactone improves left ventricular diastolic function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, however it has no effect on mortality and hospitalization.\nDue to its antiandrogenic properties, spironolactone can cause effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any longer than a short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer medication, eplerenone, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogenic effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, eplerenone may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related medication canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure.\n\nHigh blood pressure: About 1 in 100 people with hypertension have elevated levels of aldosterone; in these people, the antihypertensive effect of spironolactone may exceed that of complex combined regimens of other antihypertensives since it targets the primary cause of the elevated blood pressure. However, a Cochrane review found adverse effects at high doses and little effect on blood pressure at low doses in the majority of people with high blood pressure. There is no evidence of person-oriented outcome at any dose in this group.\n\nHigh aldosterone levels: Spironolactone is used in the treatment of hyperaldosteronism (high aldosterone levels or mineralocorticoid excess), for instance primary aldosteronism (Conn's syndrome). Antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone and eplerenone are first-line treatments for hyperaldosteronism. They improve blood pressure and potassium levels, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy, albuminuria, and carotid intima-media thickness, in people with primary aldosteronism. In people with hyperaldosteronism due to unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma, adrenalectomy should be preferred instead of antimineralocorticoids. Spironolactone should not be used to treat primary aldosteronism in pregnancy due to its antiandrogen-related risk of teratogenicity in male fetuses.\n\nSkin and hair conditions: Androgens like testosterone and DHT play a critical role in the pathogenesis of a number of dermatological conditions including oily skin, acne, seborrhea, hirsutism (excessive facial/body hair growth in women), and male pattern hair loss (androgenic alopecia). In demonstration of this, women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) do not produce sebum or develop acne and have little to no body, pubic, or axillary hair. Moreover, men with congenital 5\u03b1-reductase type II deficiency, 5\u03b1-reductase being an enzyme that greatly potentiates the androgenic effects of testosterone in the skin, have little to no acne, scanty facial hair, reduced body hair, and reportedly no incidence of male-pattern hair loss. Conversely, hyperandrogenism in women, for instance due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), is commonly associated with acne and hirsutism as well as virilization (masculinization) in general. In accordance with the preceding, antiandrogens are highly effective in the treatment of the aforementioned androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions.\nBecause of the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, it can be quite effective in treating acne in women. In addition, spironolactone reduces oil that is naturally produced in the skin and can be used to treat oily skin. Though not the primary intended purpose of the medication, the ability of spironolactone to be helpful with problematic skin and acne conditions was discovered to be one of the beneficial side effects and has been quite successful. Oftentimes, for women treating acne, spironolactone is prescribed and paired with a birth control pill. Positive results in the pairing of these two medications have been observed, although these results may not be seen for up to three months. Spironolactone has been reported to produce a 50 to 100% improvement in acne at sufficiently high doses. Response to treatment generally requires 1 to 3 months in the case of acne and up to 6 months in the case of hirsutism. Ongoing therapy is generally required to avoid relapse of symptoms. Spironolactone is commonly used in the treatment of hirsutism in women, and is considered to be a first-line antiandrogen for this indication. Spironolactone can be used in the treatment of female-pattern hair loss (pattern scalp hair loss in women). There is tentative low quality evidence supporting its use for this indication. Although apparently effective, not all cases of female-pattern hair loss are dependent on androgens.\nAntiandrogens like spironolactone are male-specific teratogens which can feminize male fetuses due to their antiandrogenic effects. For this reason, it is recommended that antiandrogens only be used to treat women who are of reproductive age in conjunction with adequate contraception. Oral contraceptives, which contain an estrogen and a progestin, are typically used for this purpose. Moreover, oral contraceptives themselves are functional antiandrogens and are independently effective in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions, and hence can significantly augment the effectiveness of antiandrogens in the treatment of such conditions.\nSpironolactone is not generally used in men for the treatment of androgen-dependent dermatological conditions because of its feminizing side effects, but it is effective for such indications in men similarly. As an example, spironolactone has been reported to reduce symptoms of acne in males. An additional example is the usefulness of spironolactone as an antiandrogen in transgender women and nonbinary individuals.\nTopical spironolactone is effective in the treatment of acne as well. As a result, topical pharmaceutical formulations containing 2% or 5% spironolactone cream became available in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism in the early 1990s. The products were discontinued in 2006 when the creams were added to the list of doping substances with a decree of the Ministry of Health that year.\n\nComparison: Spironolactone, the 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor finasteride, and the nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide all appear to have similar effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism. However, some clinical research has found that the effectiveness of spironolactone for hirsutism is greater than that of finasteride but is less than that of flutamide. The combination of spironolactone with finasteride is more effective than either alone for hirsutism and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill is more effective than a birth control pill alone. One study showed that spironolactone or the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate both in combination with a birth control pill had equivalent effectiveness for hirsutism. Spironolactone is considered to be a first-line treatment for hirsutism, finasteride and the steroidal antiandrogen cyproterone acetate are considered to be second-line treatments, and flutamide is no longer recommended for hirsutism due to liver toxicity concerns. The nonsteroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide is an alternative option to flutamide with improved safety.\nThe combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill in the treatment of acne appears to have similar effectiveness to a birth control pill alone and the combination of a birth control pill with cyproterone acetate, flutamide, or finasteride. However, this was based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. Spironolactone may be more effective than birth control pills in the treatment of acne, and the combination of spironolactone with a birth control pill may have greater effectiveness for acne than either alone. In addition, some clinical research has found that flutamide is more effective than spironolactone in the treatment of acne. In one study, flutamide decreased acne scores by 80% within 3 months, whereas spironolactone decreased symptoms by only 40% in the same period. However, the use of flutamide for acne is limited by its liver toxicity. Bicalutamide is a potential alternative to flutamide for acne as well. Spironolactone can be considered as a first-line treatment for acne in those who have failed other standard treatments such as topical therapies and under certain other circumstances, although this is controversial due to the side effects of spironolactone and its teratogenicity.\nThere is insufficient clinical evidence to compare the effectiveness of spironolactone with other antiandrogens for female-pattern hair loss. The effectiveness of spironolactone in the treatment of both acne and hirsutism appears to be dose-dependent, with higher doses being more effective than lower doses. However, higher doses also have greater side effects, such as menstrual irregularities.\n\nTransgender hormone therapy: Despite paradoxical reactions, spironolactone is used off-label as a component of feminizing hormone therapy in transgender women, especially in the United States (where cyproterone acetate is not available), usually in addition to an estrogen. Alternatives like bicalutamide do not have a similar level of popularity. As spironolactone's antiandrogenic effect appears only in high doses, it can have a wide array of side effects not found in antiandrogens working more exclusively on the androgen receptor. When coupled with estradiol, effects in transgender women include decreased male pattern body hair, induction of breast development and of feminization in general, and reduced spontaneous erections.\n\nForms: Spironolactone is available in the form of tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg; brand name Aldactone, others) and suspensions (25 mg/5 mL; brand name Carospir) for use by mouth. It has also been marketed in the form of 2% and 5% topical cream in Italy for the treatment of acne and hirsutism under the brand name Spiroderm, but this product is no longer available. The medication is also available in combination with other medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide (brand name Aldactazide, others). Spironolactone has poor water solubility, and for this reason, only oral and topical formulations have been developed; other routes of administration such as intravenous injection are not used. The only antimineralocorticoid that is available as a solution for parenteral use is the related medication potassium canrenoate.\n\nContraindications: Contraindications of spironolactone include hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), severe and end-stage kidney disease (due to high hyperkalemia risk, except possibly in those on dialysis), Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency and low aldosterone levels), and concomitant use of eplerenone. It should also be used with caution in people with certain neurological disorders, as well as those who experience or have experienced anuria (lack of urine production), acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of kidney excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia.\n\nSide effects: One of the most common side effects of spironolactone is frequent urination. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because of its antiandrogenic activity, spironolactone can cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), feminization in general, and demasculinization, as well as sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction, although these side effects are usually confined to high doses of spironolactone. At very high doses (400 mg/day), spironolactone has also been associated with testicular atrophy and reversibly reduced fertility, including semen abnormalities such as decreased sperm count and motility in cis men. However, such doses of spironolactone are rarely used clinically. In cis women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and breast enlargement. Aside from these adverse effects, the side effects of spironolactone in women taking high doses are minimal, and it is well tolerated.\nA potential side effect of spironolactone is hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which, in severe cases, can be life-threatening. Hyperkalemia can present as a normal anion-gap metabolic acidosis. It has been reported that the addition of spironolactone to loop diuretics in people with heart failure was associated with a higher risk of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury. Spironolactone may put people at a heightened risk for gastrointestinal issues like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramping, and gastritis. In addition, there has been some evidence suggesting an association between use of the medication and bleeding from the stomach and duodenum, though a causal relationship between the two has not been established. Also, spironolactone is immunosuppressive in the treatment of sarcoidosis.\nMost of the side effects of spironolactone are dose-dependent. Low-dose spironolactone is generally very well tolerated. Even higher doses of spironolactone, such as 100 mg/day, are well tolerated in most individuals. Dose-dependent side effects of spironolactone include menstrual irregularities, breast tenderness, and enlargement, orthostatic hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The side effects of spironolactone are usually mild and rarely result in discontinuation.\n\nHigh potassium levels: Spironolactone can cause hyperkalemia, or high blood potassium levels. Rarely, this can be fatal. Of people with heart disease prescribed typical dosages of spironolactone, 10 to 15% develop some degree of hyperkalemia, and 6% develop severe hyperkalemia. At a higher dosage, a rate of hyperkalemia of 24% has been observed. An abrupt and major increase in the rate of hospitalization due to hyperkalemia from 0.2% to 11% and in the rate of death due to hyperkalemia from 0.3 per 1,000 to 2.0 per 1,000 between early 1994 and late 2001 has been attributed to a parallel rise in the number of prescriptions written for spironolactone upon the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) in July 1999. However, another population-based study in Scotland failed to replicate these findings. The risk of hyperkalemia with spironolactone is greatest in the elderly, in people with renal impairment (e.g., due to chronic kidney disease or diabetic nephropathy), in people taking certain other medications (including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the antibiotic trimethoprim, and potassium supplements), and at higher dosages of spironolactone.\nAlthough spironolactone poses an important risk of hyperkalemia in the elderly, in those with kidney or cardiovascular disease, and/or in those taking medications or supplements which increase circulating potassium levels, a large retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in young women without such characteristics who had been treated with high doses of spironolactone for dermatological conditions did not differ from that of controls. This was the conclusion of a 2017 hybrid systematic review of studies of spironolactone for acne in women as well, which found that hyperkalemia was rare and was invariably mild and clinically insignificant. These findings suggest that hyperkalemia may not be a significant risk in such individuals, and that routine monitoring of circulating potassium levels may be unnecessary in this population. However, other sources have claimed that hyperkalemia can nonetheless also occur in people with more normal renal function and presumably without such risk factors. Occasional testing on a case-by-case basis in those with known risk factors may be justified. Side effects of spironolactone which may be indicative of hyperkalemia and if persistent could justify serum potassium testing include nausea, fatigue, and particularly muscle weakness. Notably, non-use of routine potassium monitoring with spironolactone in young women would reduce costs associated with its use.\nAmong young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone, hyperkalemia is rare and (if present) transient and asymptomatic. Larger doses do not appear to increase risks in this population. A broader retrospective study found that the rate of hyperkalemia in gender-diverse individuals is correlated with age, with those above 45 years old being more at risk. The finding suggests that patients below or at 45 years old without other conditions that affect potassium handling can be spared from routine monitoring.\n\nBreast changes: Spironolactone can cause breast pain and breast enlargement in women. This is \"probably because of estrogenic effects on target tissue.\" At low doses, breast tenderness has been reported in only 5% of women, but at high doses, it has been reported in up to 40% of women. Breast enlargement and tenderness may occur in 26% of women at high doses. Some women regard spironolactone-induced breast enlargement as a positive effect.\nSpironolactone also commonly and dose-dependently produces gynecomastia (breast development) as a side effect in men. At low doses, the rate is only 5 to 10%, but at high doses, up to or exceeding 50% of men may develop gynecomastia. In the RALES, 9.1% of men taking 25 mg/day spironolactone developed gynecomastia, compared to 1.3% of controls. Conversely, in studies of healthy men given high-dose spironolactone, gynecomastia occurred in 3 of 10 (30%) at 100 mg/day, in 5 of 8 (62.5%) at 200 mg/day, and in 6 of 9 (66.7%) at 400 mg/day, relative to none of 12 controls. The severity of gynecomastia with spironolactone varies considerably, but is usually mild. As with breast enlargement caused by spironolactone in women, gynecomastia due to spironolactone in men is often although inconsistently accompanied by breast tenderness. In the RALES, only 1.7% of men developed breast pain, relative to 0.1% of controls.\nThe time to onset of spironolactone-induced gynecomastia has been found to be 27 \u00b1 20 months at low doses and 9 \u00b1 12 months at high doses. Gynecomastia induced by spironolactone usually regresses after a few weeks following discontinuation of the medication. However, after a sufficient duration of gynecomastia being present (e.g., one year), hyalinization and fibrosis of the tissue occurs and drug-induced gynecomastia may become irreversible.\n\nMenstrual disturbances: Spironolactone at higher doses can cause menstrual irregularities as a side effect in women. These irregularities include metrorrhagia (intermenstrual bleeding), amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), and breakthrough bleeding. They are common during spironolactone therapy, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses and almost all experiencing them at a high doses. For example, about 20% of women experienced menstrual irregularities with 50 to 100 mg/day spironolactone, whereas about 70% experienced menstrual irregularities at 200 mg/day. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular and anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) in large percentages of women, as well as with polymenorrhea (short menstrual cycles). The medication reportedly has no birth control effect.\nIt has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17\u03b1-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels. Indeed, CYP17A1 genotype is associated with polymenorrhea. Regardless of their mechanism, the menstrual disturbances associated with spironolactone can usually be controlled well by concomitant treatment with a birth control pill, due to the progestin component.\n\nMood changes: Research is mixed on whether antimineralocorticoids like spironolactone have positive or negative effects on mood. In any case, it is possible that spironolactone might have the capacity to increase the risk of depressive symptoms. However, a 2017 hybrid systematic review found that the incidence of depression in women treated with spironolactone for acne was less than 1%. Likewise, a 10-year observational study found that the incidence of depression in 196 transgender women taking high-dose spironolactone in combination with an estrogen was less than 1%.\n\nLipid changes: Spironolactone has been found to increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and decrease HDL (\"good\") cholesterol levels at the relatively high doses used in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). As such, it may have unfavorable effects on the blood lipid profile in this context. Heightened LDL cholesterol levels are a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. Consequently, it has been said that spironolactone should not be given to women with dyslipidemia (e.g., high cholesterol). Unfavorable lipid changes have also been seen with other antiandrogens, like cyproterone acetate and bicalutamide.\n\nRare reactions: Aside from hyperkalemia, spironolactone may rarely cause adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis, kidney failure, hepatitis (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Five cases of breast cancer in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported.\n\nSpironolactone bodies: Long-term administration of spironolactone gives the histologic characteristic of \"spironolactone bodies\" in the adrenal cortex. Spironolactone bodies are eosinophilic, round, concentrically laminated cytoplasmic inclusions surrounded by clear halos in preparations stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\nPregnancy and breastfeeding: Spironolactone can cross the placenta. It has been found to be present in the breast milk of lactating mothers. However, only very small amounts of spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone enter breast milk, and the amount received by an infant during breastfeeding (<0.5% of the mother's dose) is considered to be insignificant.\nA study found that spironolactone was not associated with teratogenicity in the offspring of rats. Because it is an antiandrogen, however, spironolactone could theoretically have the potential to cause feminization of male fetuses at sufficient doses. In accordance, a subsequent study found that partial feminization of the genitalia occurred in the male offspring of rats that received doses of spironolactone that were five times higher than those normally used in humans (200 mg/kg per day). Another study found permanent, dose-related reproductive tract abnormalities rat offspring of both sexes at lower doses (50 to 100 mg/kg per day).\nIn practice however, although experience is limited, spironolactone has never been reported to cause observable feminization or any other congenital defects in humans. Among 31 human newborns exposed to spironolactone in the first trimester, there were no signs of any specific birth defects. A case report described a woman who was prescribed spironolactone during pregnancy with triplets and delivered all three (one boy and two girls) healthy; there was no feminization in the boy. In addition, spironolactone has been used at high doses to treat pregnant women with Bartter's syndrome, and none of the infants (three boys, two girls) showed toxicity, including feminization in the male infants. There are similar findings, albeit also limited, for another antiandrogen, cyproterone acetate (prominent genital defects in male rats, but no human abnormalities (including feminization of male fetuses) at both a low dose of 2 mg/day or high doses of 50 to 100 mg/day). In any case, spironolactone is nonetheless not recommended during pregnancy due to theoretical concerns relating to feminization of males and also to potential alteration of fetal potassium levels.\nA 2019 systematic review found insufficient evidence that spironolactone causes birth defects in humans. However, there was also insufficient evidence to be certain that it does not.\n\nOverdose: Spironolactone is relatively safe in acute overdose. Symptoms following an acute overdose of spironolactone may include drowsiness, confusion, maculopapular or erythematous rash, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and diarrhea. In rare cases, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, or hepatic coma may occur in individuals with severe liver disease. However, these adverse reactions are unlikely in the event of an acute overdose. Hyperkalemia can occur following an overdose of spironolactone, and this is especially so in people with decreased kidney function. Spironolactone has been studied at extremely high oral doses of up to 2,400 mg per day in clinical trials. Its oral median lethal dose (LD50) is more than 1,000 mg/kg in mice, rats, and rabbits.\nThere is no specific antidote for overdose of spironolactone. Treatment may consist of induction of vomiting or stomach evacuation by gastric lavage. The treatment of spironolactone overdose is supportive, with the purpose of maintaining hydration, electrolyte balance, and vital functions. Spironolactone should be discontinued in people with impaired kidney function or hyperkalemia.\n\nInteractions: Spironolactone often increases serum potassium levels and can cause hyperkalemia, a very serious condition. Therefore, it is recommended that people using this medication avoid potassium supplements and salt substitutes containing potassium. Physicians must be careful to monitor potassium levels in both males and females who are taking spironolactone as a diuretic, especially during the first twelve months of use and whenever the dosage is increased. Doctors may also recommend that some patients may be advised to limit dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods. However, recent data suggests that both potassium monitoring and dietary restriction of potassium intake is unnecessary in healthy young women taking spironolactone for acne and in healthy young gender-diverse individuals taking spironolactone for hormone therapy. Spironolactone together with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole increases the likelihood of hyperkalemia, especially in the elderly. The trimethoprim portion acts to prevent potassium excretion in the distal tubule of the nephron.\nSpironolactone has been reported to induce the enzymes CYP3A4 and certain UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which can result in interactions with various medications. However, it has also been reported that metabolites of spironolactone irreversibly inhibit CYP3A4. In any case, spironolactone has been found to reduce the bioavailability of oral estradiol, which could be due to induction of estradiol metabolism via CYP3A4. Spironolactone has also been found to inhibit UGT2B7. Spironolactone can also have numerous other interactions, most commonly with other cardiac and blood pressure medications, for instance digoxin.\nLicorice, which has indirect mineralocorticoid activity by inhibiting mineralocorticoid metabolism, has been found to inhibit the antimineralocorticoid effects of spironolactone. Moreover, the addition of licorice to spironolactone has been found to reduce the antimineralocorticoid side effects of spironolactone in women treated with it for hyperandrogenism, and licorice hence may be used to reduce these side effects in women treated with spironolactone as an antiandrogen who are bothered by them. On the opposite end of the spectrum, spironolactone is useful in reversing licorice-induced hypokalemia. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been found to attenuate the diuresis and natriuresis induced by spironolactone, but, not to affect its antihypertensive effect.\nSome research has suggested that spironolactone might be able to interfere with the effectiveness of antidepressant treatment. As the medication acts as an antimineralocorticoid, it is thought that it might be able to reduce the effectiveness of certain antidepressants by interfering with normalization of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis and by increasing levels of glucocorticoids such as cortisol. However, other research contradicts this hypothesis and has suggested that spironolactone might produce antidepressant effects. For instance, studies showing antidepressant-like effects of spironolactone in animals.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: The pharmacodynamics of spironolactone are characterized by high antimineralocorticoid activity, moderate antiandrogenic activity, and weak steroidogenesis inhibition, among other more minor activities. Spironolactone is a prodrug, so most of its actions are actually mediated by its various active metabolites. The major active forms of spironolactone are 7\u03b1-thiomethylspironolactone (7\u03b1-TMS) and canrenone (7\u03b1-desthioacetyl-\u03b46-spironolactone).\nSpironolactone is a potent antimineralocorticoid. That is, it is an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), the biological target of mineralocorticoids like aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. By blocking the MR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of mineralocorticoids in the body. The antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone is responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of edema, high blood pressure, heart failure, hyperaldosteronism, and ascites due to cirrhosis. It is also responsible for many of the side effects of spironolactone, such as urinary frequency, dehydration, hyponatremia, low blood pressure, fatigue, dizziness, metabolic acidosis, decreased kidney function, and its risk of hyperkalemia. Due to the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone, levels of aldosterone are significantly increased by the medication, probably reflecting an attempt of the body to maintain homeostasis.\nSpironolactone is a moderate antiandrogen. That is, it is an antagonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). By blocking the AR, spironolactone inhibits the effects of androgens in the body. The antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone is mainly responsible for its therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of androgen-dependent skin and hair conditions like acne, seborrhea, hirsutism, and pattern hair loss and hyperandrogenism in women, precocious puberty in boys with testotoxicosis, and as a component of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. It is also primarily responsible for some of its side effects, like breast tenderness, gynecomastia, feminization, and demasculinization in men. Blockade of androgen signaling in the breast disinhibits the actions of estrogens in this tissue. Although useful as an antiandrogen in women, who have low testosterone levels compared to men, spironolactone is described as having relatively weak antiandrogenic activity.\nSpironolactone is a weak steroidogenesis inhibitor. That is, it inhibits steroidogenic enzymes, or enzymes involved in the production of steroid hormones. Spironolactone and/or its metabolites have been found in vitro to weakly inhibit a broad array of steroidogenic enzymes including cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, 17\u03b1-hydroxylase, 17,20-lyase, 5\u03b1-reductase, 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 11\u03b2-hydroxylase, 21-hydroxylase, and aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase). However, although very high doses of spironolactone can considerably decrease steroid hormone levels in animals, spironolactone has shown mixed and inconsistent effects on steroid hormone levels in clinical studies, even at high clinical doses. In any case, the levels of most steroid hormones, including testosterone and cortisol, are usually unchanged by spironolactone in humans, which may in part be related to compensatory upregulation of their synthesis. The weak steroidogenesis inhibition of spironolactone might contribute to its antiandrogenic efficacy to some degree and may explain its side effect of menstrual irregularities in women. However, its androgen synthesis inhibition is probably clinically insignificant.\nSpironolactone has been found in some studies to increase levels of estradiol, an estrogen, although many other studies have found no changes in estradiol levels. The mechanism of how spironolactone increases estradiol levels is unclear, but it may involve inhibition of the inactivation of estradiol into estrone and enhancement of the peripheral conversion of testosterone into estradiol. It is notable that spironolactone has been found in vitro to act as a weak inhibitor of 17\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2, an enzyme that is involved in the conversion of estradiol into estrone. Increased levels of estradiol with spironolactone may be involved in its preservation of bone density and in its side effects such as breast tenderness, breast enlargement, and gynecomastia in women and men.\nIn response to the antimineralocorticoid activity spironolactone, and in an attempt to maintain homeostasis, the body increases aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex. Some studies have found that levels of cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone that is also produced in the adrenal cortex, are increased as well. Spironolactone \u201cacts at the basolateral side of the upper-distal tubule as well as in the collecting tubule,\u201d and does not have glucocorticoid-like effects at these specific sites; it can sometimes be prescribed as an alternative to glucocorticoids for patients with Glucocorticoid-Remediable Aldosteronism characterized by aldosterone excess, In patients \u201creceiving spironolactone, there was a significant positive correlation between the change in cortisol and the change in HbA1c (r = 0.489, P = .003).\u201d Patients taking spironolactone must be monitored for side effects including dizziness, headache, fatigue, diarrhea, hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.\nOther activities of spironolactone may include very weak interactions with the estrogen and progesterone receptors and agonism of the pregnane X receptor. These activities could contribute to the menstrual irregularities and breast side effects of spironolactone and to its drug interactions, respectively.\n\nPharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of spironolactone have not been studied well, which is in part because it is an old medication that was developed in the 1950s. Nonetheless, much has been elucidated about the pharmacokinetics of spironolactone over the decades.\n\nAbsorption: The bioavailability of spironolactone when taken by mouth is 60 to 90%. The bioavailability of spironolactone and its metabolites increases significantly (+22\u201395% increases in levels) when spironolactone is taken with food, although it is uncertain whether this further increases the therapeutic effects of the medication. The increase in bioavailability is thought to be due to promotion of the gastric dissolution and absorption of spironolactone, as well as due to a decrease of the first-pass metabolism. The relationship between a single dose of spironolactone and plasma levels of canrenone, a major active metabolite of spironolactone, has been found to be linear across a dose range of 25 to 200 mg spironolactone. Steady-state concentrations of spironolactone are achieved within 8 to 10 days of treatment initiation.\nLittle or no systemic absorption has been observed with topical spironolactone.\n\nDistribution: Spironolactone and its metabolite canrenone are highly plasma protein bound, with percentages of 88.0% and 99.2%, respectively. Spironolactone is bound equivalently to albumin and \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, while canrenone is bound only to albumin. Spironolactone and its metabolite 7\u03b1-thiospironolactone show very low or negligible affinity for sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In accordance, a study of high-dosage spironolactone treatment found no change in steroid binding capacity related to SHBG or to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), suggesting that spironolactone does not displace steroid hormones from their carrier proteins. This is in contradiction with widespread statements that spironolactone increases free estradiol levels by displacing estradiol from SHBG.\nSpironolactone appears to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier.\n\nMetabolism: Spironolactone is rapidly and extensively metabolized in the liver upon oral administration and has a very short terminal half-life of 1.4 hours. The major metabolites of spironolactone are 7\u03b1-thiomethylspironolactone (7\u03b1-TMS), 6\u03b2-hydroxy-7\u03b1-thiomethylspironolactone (6\u03b2-OH-7\u03b1-TMS), and canrenone (7\u03b1-desthioacetyl-\u03b46-spironolactone). These metabolites have much longer elimination half-lives than spironolactone of 13.8 hours, 15.0 hours, and 16.5 hours, respectively, and are responsible for the therapeutic effects of the medication. As such, spironolactone is a prodrug. The 7\u03b1-thiomethylated metabolites of spironolactone were not known for many years and it was originally thought that canrenone was the major active metabolite of the medication, but subsequent research identified 7\u03b1-TMS as the major metabolite. Other known but more minor metabolites of spironolactone include 7\u03b1-thiospironolactone (7\u03b1-TS), which is an important intermediate to the major metabolites of spironolactone, as well as the 7\u03b1-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone and the 6\u03b2-hydroxy-7\u03b1-methyl ethyl ester of spironolactone.\nSpironolactone is hydrolyzed or deacetylated at the thioester of the C7\u03b1 position into 7\u03b1-TS by carboxylesterases. Following formation of 7\u03b1-TS, it is S-oxygenated by flavin-containing monooxygenases to form an electrophilic sulfenic acid metabolite. This metabolite is involved in the CYP450 inhibition of spironolactone, and also binds covalently to other proteins. 7\u03b1-TS is also S-methylated into 7\u03b1-TMS, a transformation catalyzed by thiol S-methyltransferase. Unlike the related medication eplerenone, spironolactone is said to not be metabolized by CYP3A4. However, hepatic CYP3A4 is likely responsible for the 6\u03b2-hydroxylation of 7\u03b1-TMS into 6\u03b2-OH-7\u03b1-TMS. 7\u03b1-TMS may also be hydroxylated at the C3\u03b1 and C3\u03b2 positions. Spironolactone is dethioacetylated into canrenone. Finally, the C17 \u03b3-lactone ring of spironolactone is hydrolyzed by the paraoxonase PON3. It was originally thought to be hydrolyzed by PON1, but this was due to contamination with PON3.\n\nElimination: The majority of spironolactone is eliminated by the kidneys, while minimal amounts are handled by biliary excretion.\n\nChemistry: Spironolactone, also known as 7\u03b1-acetylthiospirolactone, is a steroidal 17\u03b1-spirolactone, or more simply a spirolactone. It can most appropriately be conceptualized as a derivative of progesterone, itself also a potent antimineralocorticoid, in which a hydroxyl group has been substituted at the C17\u03b1 position (as in 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone), the acetyl group at the C17\u03b2 position has been cyclized with the C17\u03b1 hydroxyl group to form a spiro 21-carboxylic acid \u03b3-lactone ring, and an acetylthio group has been substituted in at the C7\u03b1 position. These structural modifications of progesterone confer increased oral bioavailability and potency, potent antiandrogenic activity, and strongly reduced progestogenic activity. The C7\u03b1 substitution is likely responsible for or involved in the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone, as 7\u03b1-thioprogesterone (SC-8365), unlike progesterone, is an antiandrogen with similar affinity to the AR as that of spironolactone. In addition, the C7\u03b1 substitution appears to be responsible for the loss of progestogenic activity and good oral bioavailability of spironolactone, as SC-5233, the analogue of spironolactone without a C7\u03b1 substitution, has potent progestogenic activity but very poor oral bioavailability similarly to progesterone.\n\nNames: Spironolactone is also known by the following equivalent chemical names:\n\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-17\u03b1-hydroxy-3-oxopregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid \u03b3-lactone\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-3-oxo-17\u03b1-pregn-4-ene-21,17\u03b2-carbolactone\n3-(3-Oxo-7\u03b1-acetylthio-17\u03b2-hydroxyandrost-4-en-17\u03b1-yl)propionic acid lactone\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-17\u03b1-(2-carboxyethyl)androst-4-en-17\u03b2-ol-3-one \u03b3-lactone\n7\u03b1-Acetylthio-17\u03b1-(2-carboxyethyl)testosterone \u03b3-lactone\n\nAnalogues: Spironolactone is closely related structurally to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and eplerenone, as well as to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7\u03b1-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).\n\nSynthesis: Chemical syntheses of spironolactone and its analogues and derivatives have been described and reviewed.\n\nHistory: The natriuretic effects of progesterone were demonstrated in 1955, and the development of spironolactone as a synthetic antimineralocorticoid analogue of progesterone shortly followed this. Spironolactone was first synthesized in 1957, was patented between 1958 and 1961, and was first marketed, as an antimineralocorticoid, in 1959. Gynecomastia was first reported with spironolactone in 1962, and the antiandrogenic activity of the medication was first described in 1969. This shortly followed the discovery in 1967 that gynecomastia is an important and major side effect of AR antagonists. Spironolactone was first studied in the treatment of hirsutism in women in 1978. It has since become the most widely used antiandrogen for dermatological indications in women in the United States. Spironolactone was first studied as an antiandrogen in transgender women in 1986, and has since become widely adopted for this purpose as well, particularly in the United States where cyproterone acetate is not available.\nEarly oral spironolactone tablets showed poor absorption. The formulation was eventually changed to a micronized formulation with particle sizes of less than 50 \u03bcg, which resulted in approximately 4-fold increased potency.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nGeneric names: The English, French, and generic name of the medication is spironolactone and this is its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANTooltip British Approved Name, DCFTooltip D\u00e9nomination Commune Fran\u00e7aise, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its name is spironolactonum in Latin, Spironolacton in German, espironolactona in Spanish and Portuguese, and spironolattone in Italian (which is also its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana).\nSpironolactone is also known by its developmental code names SC-9420 and NSC-150339.\n\nBrand names: Spironolactone is marketed under various brand names throughout the world. The original brand name of spironolactone is Aldactone. Other brand names include Aldactone-A, Berlactone, CaroSpir, Espironolactona, Espironolactona Genfar, Novo-Spiroton, Prilactone (veterinary), Spiractin, Spiridon, Spirix, Spiroctan, Spiroderm (discontinued), Spirogamma, Spirohexal, Spirolon, Spirolone, Spiron, Spironolactone Actavis, Spironolactone Orion, Spironolactone Teva, Spirotone, Tempora (veterinary), Uractone, Uractonum, Verospiron, and Vivitar.\nSpironolactone is also formulated in combination with a variety of other medications, including with hydrochlorothiazide as Aldactazide, with hydroflumethiazide as Aldactide, Lasilacton, Lasilactone, and Spiromide, with altizide as Aldactacine and Aldactazine, with furosemide as Fruselac, with benazepril as Cardalis (veterinary), with metolazone as Metolactone, with bendroflumethiazide as Sali-Aldopur, and with torasemide as Dytor Plus, Torlactone, and Zator Plus.\n\nAvailability: Spironolactone is marketed throughout the world.\n\nResearch: \n\nProstate conditions: Spironolactone has been studied at a high dosage in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; enlarged prostate). It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, it has been said that spironolactone has no place in the treatment of BPH.\nSpironolactone has been studied and used limitedly in the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\nEpstein\u2013Barr virus: Spironolactone has been found to block Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) production and that of other human herpesviruses by inhibiting the function of an EBV protein SM, which is essential for infectious virus production. This effect of spironolactone was determined to be independent of its antimineralocorticoid actions.\n\nOther conditions: Spironolactone has been studied in the treatment of rosacea in both males and females.\nSpironolactone has been studied in fibromyalgia in women. It has also been studied in bulimia nervosa in women, but was not found to be effective.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nSpironolactone can cause cancer according to state or federal government labeling requirements.\nSpironolactone is a steroid lactone that is 17alpha-pregn-4-ene-21,17-carbolactone substituted by an oxo group at position 3 and an alpha-acetylsulfanyl group at position 7.

        "text2": "Title: Dapsone\nwikipedia: Dapsone, also known as 4,4'-sulfonyldianiline (SDA) or diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS), is an antibiotic commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. It is a second-line medication for the treatment and prevention of pneumocystis pneumonia and for the prevention of toxoplasmosis in those who have poor immune function. Additionally, it has been used for acne, dermatitis herpetiformis, and various other skin conditions. Dapsone is available both topically and by mouth.\nSevere side effects may include a decrease in blood cells, red blood cell breakdown especially in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G-6-PD), or hypersensitivity. Common side effects include nausea and loss of appetite. Other side effects include liver inflammation, methemoglobinemia, and a number of types of skin rashes. While the safety of use during pregnancy is not entirely clear some physicians recommend that it be continued in those with leprosy. It is of the sulfone class.\nDapsone was first studied as an antibiotic in 1937. Its use for leprosy began in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The form, which is taken by mouth, is available as a generic drug and not very expensive.\n\nMedical uses: \n\nInfections: Dapsone is commonly used in combination with rifampicin and clofazimine for the treatment of leprosy. It is also used to both treat and prevent pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). It is also used for toxoplasmosis in people unable to tolerate trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole.\nDapsone by mouth was one of the first medications used to treat moderate to severe acne vulgaris, and is still occasionally prescribed for the treatment of severe cases. A topical form of dapsone is also effective with potentially less side effects.\nIt is unclear if the combination with pyrimethamine is useful in the prevention of malaria.\n\nAutoimmune disease: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Dapsone is effective and safe in persons with moderate, severe, or refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus.\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Dapsone is effective and safe for adjunctive glucocorticoid-sparing treatment of persons with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and is preferred over danazol or interferon alpha in those people with antinuclear antibodies.\nChronic spontaneous urticaria. Dapsone is effective and safe for treatment of second-line therapy for people with chronic spontaneous urticaria in those for whom antihistamines and other first-line agents have failed.\nRelapsing polychondritis. There are no clinical trials but there are many case reports that dapsone is effective at doses of 25 mg/day to 200 mg/day for treatment of relapsing polychondritis.\n\nOther: Dermatitis herpetiformis in combination with a gluten-free diet.\nDapsone may be used to treat brown recluse spider bites that become necrotic.\nDapsone is the recommended treatment for erythema elevatum diutinum, as a review found that using oral dapsone alone was effective in 80% of early cases of the disease. However, dapsone can potentially cause severe side effects, meaning that sometimes steroids or other antibiotics should be used instead, although these alternative treatments are much less effective.\nAn August 2015 review notes that dapsone is reported to be effective against generalized granuloma annulare.\nDapsone has been used as a monomer in the design of dye adsorbent polymers.\n\nContraindications and precautions: People with porphyria, anemia, cardiac disease, lung disease, HIV infection, G6PD deficiency, and liver impairment are at higher risks of adverse effects when using dapsone.\n\nAdverse effects: Hypersensitivity reactions occur in 1.4% of persons treated with dapsone, and can be fatal in medical settings with low resources. It is a form of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in which a SCARs disorder, primarily the DRESS syndrome or a DRESS syndrome-like reaction occurs.\n\nBlood: Hemolysis is the most prominent side-effect, occurring in about 20 % of patients treated with dapsone, although it is dose-related. It may lead to hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia. The side-effect is more common and severe in those with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, leading to the dapsone-containing antimalarial combination Lapdap being withdrawn from clinical use. A case of hemolysis in a neonate from dapsone in breast milk has been reported. Agranulocytosis occurs rarely when dapsone is used alone but more frequently in combination regimens for malaria prophylaxis. Abnormalities in white blood cell formation, including aplastic anemia, are rare, yet are the cause of the majority of deaths attributable to dapsone therapy.\nMethemoglobinemia occurs in about 15 % of patients treated with long-term dapsone at standard doses (100 mg/day). Only special multi-wavelength oximeters (CO-oximeters) can detect methemoglobinemia directly. When there is a \"saturation gap\" between a low ordinary pulse oximeter reading and a high arterial blood gas analysis result, methemoglobinemia may be suspected.\n\nLiver: Toxic hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice have been reported by the manufacturer. These toxic reactions may also occur as part of the dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome (a form of SCARs-see above) or dapsone syndrome (see below). Dapsone is metabolized by the Cytochrome P450 system, specifically isozymes CYP2D6, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19. Dapsone metabolites produced by the cytochrome P450 2C19 isozyme are associated with the methemoglobinemia side effect of the drug.\n\nSkin: When used topically, dapsone can cause mild skin irritation, redness, dry skin, burning, and itching. When used together with benzoyl peroxide products, temporary yellow or orange skin discolorations can occur.\n\nDapsone hypersensitivity syndrome: Hypersensitivity reactions occur in some patients. This reaction may be more frequent in patients receiving multiple-drug therapy.\nThe reaction always involves a rash, may also include fever, jaundice, and eosinophilia, and is likely to be one manifestation of the SCARs reaction viz., the DRESS syndrome (see above). In general, these symptoms will occur within the first six weeks of therapy or not at all, and may be ameliorated by corticosteroid therapy.\n\nOther adverse effects: Other adverse effects include nausea, headache, and rash (which are common), and insomnia, psychosis, and peripheral neuropathy. Effects on the lung occur rarely and may be serious, though are generally reversible.\n\nMechanism of action: As an antibacterial, dapsone inhibits bacterial synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, via competition with para-aminobenzoate for the active site of dihydropteroate synthase, thereby inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. Though structurally distinct from dapsone, the sulfonamide group of antibacterial drugs also work in this way.\nAs an anti-inflammatory, dapsone inhibits the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-halide-mediated cytotoxic system in polymorphonucleocytes. As part of the respiratory burst that neutrophils use to kill bacteria, myeloperoxidase converts hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hypochlorous acid (HOCl). HOCl is the most potent oxidant generated by neutrophils, and can cause significant tissue damage during inflammation. Dapsone arrests myeloperoxidase in an inactive intermediate form, reversibly inhibiting the enzyme. This prevents accumulation of hypochlorous acid, and reduces tissue damage during inflammation. Myeloperoxidase inhibition has also been suggested as a neuron-sparing mechanism for reducing inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and stroke.\nDapsone's anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects are thought to be its mechanism of action in treating dermatitis herpetiformis.\nDapsone is an odorless white to creamy-white crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste.\n\nHistory: \n\nDiscovery: In the early 20th century, the German chemist Paul Ehrlich was developing theories of selective toxicity based largely on the ability of certain dyes to kill microbes. Gerhard Domagk, who would later win a Nobel Prize for his efforts, made a major breakthrough in 1932 with the discovery of the antibacterial prontosil red (sulfonamidochrysoidine). Further investigation into the involved chemicals opened the way to sulfa drug and sulfone therapy, first with the discovery of sulfanilamide, the active agent of prontosil, by Daniel Bovet and his team at Pasteur Institute (1935), then with that of dapsone independently by Ernest Fourneau in France and Gladwin Buttle in the United Kingdom.\n\nProposed use in antimalarial drugs: The spread of drug-resistant malaria in Africa has encouraged the development of new, low-cost antimalarial drugs. Plasmodium falciparum, one of the Plasmodium species that causes malaria, has developed resistance both to chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, two of the most common treatments for malaria. Artemisinin, another antimalarial drug, had been developed in the 1980s but was too expensive for large-scale use. This led GlaxoSmithKline to develop Lapdap, a combination drug consisting of chlorproguanil and dapsone. Lapdap was licensed in the United Kingdom starting in October 2003.\nOne advantage of Lapdap was that chlorproguanil and dapsone are both low-cost drugs. Another was that by virtue of being a combination drug, it was less likely to cause drug resistance. However, because dapsone causes hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency, and because G6PD deficiency affects 10-25% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, it was discovered that Lapdap is not safe for use in Africa. It was available in many African countries for four years before GlaxoSmithKline took it off the market in February 2008.\n\nDapsone gel: Dapsone had been reported in a few cases to effectively treat acne, but the risk of hemolytic anemia kept it from being widely used for this purpose. For many years scientists attempted to develop a topical formulation of dapsone that would be as effective against acne as oral dapsone, but without the hemolysis side effect. This was difficult to accomplish because dapsone is highly insoluble in aqueous solvents. In the early 2000s QLT USA developed Aczone, a 5% dapsone gel that was shown to be effective against acne without causing clinically significant declines in hemoglobin levels, even in subjects with G6PD deficiency. In February 2016, the FDA approved a 7.5% dapsone gel. This higher strength has the advantage of a once-daily application, versus twice-daily application of the 5% formulation.\n\nOther uses: 4,4-Diaminodiphenyl sulfone also finds uses as a curing agent for materials like epoxy resins and imine-based vitrimers, applications include in printed circuit boards, adhesives and coatings. Its use in epoxy systems typically give a resin with a high glass-transition temperature.\n\nSee also: Promin, a more-soluble derivative\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \"Dapsone\".

As a structural analog of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), dapsone inhibits dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), an enzyme important in folate synthesis, resulting in a depletion of the folate pool and a reduction in the amount of thymidylate available for DNA synthesis. Although the exact mechanism through which dapsone exerts its anti-inflammatory activity has yet to be fully elucidated, this agent interferes with the activation and oxidative damage of myeloperoxidase in neutrophils and inhibits the integrin-mediated adherence and chemotaxis of neutrophils.

        "text1": "Title: Adrenochrome\nwikipedia: Adrenochrome is a chemical compound produced by the oxidation of adrenaline (epinephrine). It was the subject of limited research from the 1950s through to the 1970s as a potential cause of schizophrenia. While it has no current medical application, the semicarbazide derivative, carbazochrome, is a hemostatic medication. \nDespite this compound's name, it is unrelated to the element chromium; instead, the \u2011chrome suffix indicates a relationship to color, as pure adrenochrome has a deep violet coloration.\n\nChemistry: The oxidation reaction that converts adrenaline into adrenochrome occurs both in vivo and in vitro. Silver oxide (Ag2O) was among the first reagents employed for this, but a variety of other oxidising agents have been used successfully. In solution, adrenochrome is pink and further oxidation of the compound causes it to polymerize into brown or black melanin compounds.\n\nHistory: Several small-scale studies (involving 15 or fewer test subjects) conducted in the 1950s and 1960s reported that adrenochrome triggered psychotic reactions such as thought disorder and derealization.\nIn 1954, researchers Abram Hoffer and Humphry Osmond claimed that adrenochrome is a neurotoxic, psychotomimetic substance and may play a role in schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.\nIn what Hoffer called the \"adrenochrome hypothesis\", he and Osmond in 1967 speculated that megadoses of vitamin C and niacin could cure schizophrenia by reducing brain adrenochrome.\nThe treatment of schizophrenia with such potent anti-oxidants is highly contested. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association reported methodological flaws in Hoffer's work on niacin as a schizophrenia treatment and referred to follow-up studies that did not confirm any benefits of the treatment. Multiple additional studies in the United States, Canada, and Australia similarly failed to find benefits of megavitamin therapy to treat schizophrenia.\nThe adrenochrome theory of schizophrenia waned, despite some evidence that it may be psychotomimetic, as adrenochrome was not detectable in people with schizophrenia.\nIn the early 2000s, interest was renewed by the discovery that adrenochrome may be produced normally as an intermediate in the formation of neuromelanin. This finding may be significant because adrenochrome is detoxified at least partially by glutathione-S-transferase. Some studies have found genetic defects in the gene for this enzyme.\nAdrenochrome is also believed to have cardiotoxic properties.\n\nIn popular culture: In his 1954 book The Doors of Perception, Aldous Huxley mentioned the discovery and the alleged effects of adrenochrome, which he likened to the symptoms of mescaline intoxication, although he had never consumed it.\nAnthony Burgess mentions adrenochrome as \"drencrom\" at the beginning of his 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange. The protagonist and his friends are drinking drug-laced milk: \"They had no license for selling liquor, but there was no law yet against prodding some of the new veshches which they used to put into the old moloko, so you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches [...]\"\nHunter S. Thompson mentioned adrenochrome in his 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. This is the likely origin of current myths surrounding this compound, because a character states that \"There's only one source for this stuff ... the adrenaline glands from a living human body. It's no good if you get it out of a corpse.\" The adrenochrome scene also appears in the novel's film adaptation. In the DVD commentary, director Terry Gilliam admits that his and Thompson's portrayal is a fictional exaggeration. Gilliam insists that the drug is entirely fictional and seems unaware of the existence of a substance with the same name.  Hunter S. Thompson also mentions adrenochrome in his book Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. In the footnotes in chapter April, page 140, he says: \"It was sometime after midnight in a ratty hotel room and my memory of the conversation is hazy, due to massive ingestion of booze, fatback, and forty cc's of adrenochrome.\"\nIn the first episode of the ITV series Lewis, \"Whom the Gods Would Destroy\", the motive for the crimes was that a prostitute had been killed years previously to harvest her adrenal glands.\nAdrenochrome is mentioned in the 2014 Warhammer 40,000 novel The Talon of Horus by Aaron Dembski-Bowden. It is described as a clear liquid beverage that is, \"harvested from the adrenal glands of living slaves [...]\"\nAdrenochrome is a subject of several far right conspiracy theories, such as QAnon and Pizzagate, with the chemical helping the theories play a similar role to earlier blood libel and Satanic ritual abuse stories. The theories commonly state that a cabal of Satanists rape and murder children, and \"harvest\" adrenochrome from their victims' blood as a drug or as an elixir of youth. In reality, adrenochrome has been produced by organic synthesis since at least 1952, is synthesized by biotechnology companies for research purposes, and has no medical or recreational uses.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Joe Schwarcz PhD QAnon\u2019s Adrenochrome Quackery  10 Feb 2022  Office for Science and Society, McGill University\nAdrenochrome Commentary at erowid.org\nAdrenochrome deposits resulting from the use of epinephrine-containing eye drops used to treat glaucoma from the Iowa Eye Atlas (searched for diagnosis = adrenochrome)\n\n\n pubchem:\nAdrenochrome is a member of indoles.\nPigment obtained by the oxidation of epinephrine.\nsafety: Irritant\nsmiles: CN1CC(C2=CC(=O)C(=O)C=C21)O\nforumla: C9H9NO3\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 179.17 g/mol\nXLogP3: -1.3\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 1\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 4\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\nExact Mass: 179.058243149 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 179.058243149 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 57.6\nHeavy Atom Count: 13\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 354\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 1\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text1": "Title: Trichloroethylene\nwikipedia: Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a halocarbon with the formula C2HCl3, commonly used as an industrial metal degreasing solvent. It is a clear, colourless, non-flammable, volatile liquid with a chloroform-like pleasant mild smell and sweet taste. Its IUPAC name is trichloroethene. Trichloroethylene has been sold under a variety of trade names. Industrial abbreviations include TCE, trichlor, Trike, Tricky and tri. Under the trade names Trimar and Trilene, it was used as a volatile anesthetic and as an inhaled obstetrical analgesic. It should not be confused with the similar 1,1,1-trichloroethane, which was commonly known as chlorothene.\n\nHistory: The earliest record of trichloroethylene synthesis dates back to 1836. It was obtained from the action of potassium hydroxide on 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane by Auguste Laurent and notated as C4HCl3 (then the atomic weight of carbon was thought to be the half of it really was). Laurent did not investigate the compound further.\nTrichloroethylene's discovery is widely attributed to E. Fischer who made it in 1864 via the reduction of hexachloroethane with hydrogen. Fischer investigated TCE and noted its boiling point as between 87 and 90 degrees Celsius. Commercial production began in Germany, in 1920 and in the US in 1925.\nThe use of trichloroethylene in the food and pharmaceutical industries has been banned in much of the world since the 1970s due to concerns about its toxicity. Legislation has forced the replacement of trichloroethylene in many processes in Europe as the chemical was classified as a carcinogen carrying an R45 risk phrase, May cause cancer. Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on n-propyl bromide which carries an R60 risk phrase of May impair fertility, and would not be a legally acceptable substitute.\n\nAnaesthesia: Trichloroethylene is a good analgesic at 0.35 to 0.5% concentrations. Trichloroethylene was used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia beginning in 1916.\n\nPioneered by Imperial Chemical Industries in Britain, under the trade name \"Trilene\" (from trichloroethylene) , its development was hailed as an anesthetic revolution. It was mostly known as \"Trimar\" in the United States. The \u2013mar suffix  indicates study and development at the University of Maryland, e.g., \"Fluoromar\" for fluroxene and \"Vinamar\" for ethyl vinyl ether\". From the 1940s through the 1980s, both in Europe and North America, trichloroethylene was used as a volatile anesthetic almost invariably administered with nitrous oxide. Marketed in the UK by Imperial Chemical Industries under the trade name Trilene it was coloured blue (with a dye called waxoline blue in 1:200,000 concentration) to avoid confusion with the similar-smelling chloroform. Trilene was stabilised with 0.01% thymol.  \nOriginally thought to possess less hepatotoxicity than chloroform, and without the unpleasant pungency and flammability of ether, TCE replaced earlier anesthetics chloroform and ether in the 1940s. TCE use was nonetheless soon found to have several pitfalls. These included promotion of cardiac arrhythmias, low volatility and high solubility preventing quick anesthetic induction, reactions with soda lime used in carbon dioxide absorbing systems, prolonged neurologic dysfunction when used with soda lime, and evidence of hepatotoxicity as had been found with chloroform. Alkali components of carbon dioxide absorbers reacted with trichloroethylene and released dichloroacetylene, a neurotoxin.\nThe introduction of halothane in 1956 greatly diminished the use of TCE as a general anesthetic in the 1960s, as halothane allowed much faster induction and recovery times and was considerably easier to administer. Trichloroethylene has been used in the production of halothane.\n\n \n \n \nTrilene was also used as an inhaled analgesic, mainly during childbirth, often self-applied by the patient. Trichloroethylene was introduced for obstetrical anaesthesia in 1943, and used until the 1980s. Its anaesthetic use was banned in the United States in 1977 but the anaesthetic use in the United Kingdom remained until the late 1980s (especially for childbirth). Fetal toxicity and concerns about the carcinogenic potential of TCE led to its abandonment in developed countries by the 1980s. TCE was used with halothane in the tri-service field anaesthetic apparatus used by the UK armed forces under field conditions. As of 2000, TCE was still in use as an anesthetic in Africa.\n\nProduction: Today, most trichloroethylene is produced from ethylene. First, ethylene is chlorinated over a ferric chloride catalyst to produce 1,2-dichloroethane:\n\nCH2=CH2 + Cl2 \u2192 ClCH2CH2Cl\nWhen heated to around 400 \u00b0C with additional chlorine, 1,2-dichloroethane is converted to trichloroethylene:\n\nClCH2CH2Cl + 2 Cl2 \u2192 ClCH=CCl2 + 3 HCl\nThis reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.\nPrior to the early 1970s, however, most trichloroethylene was produced in a two-step process from acetylene. First, acetylene was treated with chlorine using a ferric chloride catalyst at 90 \u00b0C to produce 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane according to the chemical equation:\n\nHC\u2261CH + 2 Cl2 \u2192 Cl2CHCHCl2\nThe 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane is then dehydrochlorinated to give trichloroethylene. This can be accomplished either with an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide:\n\n2 Cl2CHCHCl2 + Ca(OH)2 \u2192 2 ClCH=CCl2 + CaCl2 + 2 H2O\nor in the vapor phase by heating it to 300\u2013500 \u00b0C on a barium chloride or calcium chloride catalyst:\n\nCl2CHCHCl2 \u2192 ClCH=CCl2 + HCl\nCommon impurities in reagent and technical grade TCE are methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ethylene dichloride, tetrachloroethanes, benzene and phenol. However, these compounds are present in very small amounts and do not possess any risk.\n\nUses: Trichloroethylene is an effective solvent for a variety of organic materials. It is mainly used for cleaning. Trichloroethylene is an active ingredient (solvent) in various printing ink, varnish and industrial paint formulations. Other uses include dyeing and finishing operations, adhesive formulations, rubber processing, adhesives, lacquers, and paint strippers. It is applied before plating, anodizing, and painting.\nWhen trichloroethylene was first widely produced in the 1920s, its major use was to extract vegetable oils from plant materials such as soy, coconut, and palm. Other uses in the food industry included coffee decaffeination (removal of caffeine) and the preparation of flavoring extracts from hops and spices. TCE was used a freezing point depressant in carbon tetrachloride fire extinguishers.\nTrichloroethylene is also a chain terminator for polyvinyl chloride. Chlorination gives pentachloroethane.\n\nCleaning solvent: TCE has also been used as a dry cleaning solvent, although mostly replaced by tetrachloroethylene, except for spot cleaning where it is still used under the trade name Picrin.\nPerhaps the greatest use of TCE is as a degreaser for metal parts. It has been widely used in degreasing and cleaning since the 1920s because of its low cost, low flammability, low toxicity and high effectivity as a solvent. The demand for TCE as a degreaser began to decline in the 1950s in favor of the less toxic 1,1,1-trichloroethane. However, 1,1,1-trichloroethane production has been phased out in most of the world under the terms of the Montreal Protocol due to its contribution to the ozone depletion. As a result, trichloroethylene has experienced some resurgence in use as a degreaser.\nTrichloroethylene is used to remove grease and lanolin from wool before weaving.\nTCE has also been used in the United States to clean kerosene-fueled rocket engines (TCE was not used to clean hydrogen-fueled engines such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine). During static firing, the RP-1 fuel would leave hydrocarbon deposits and vapors in the engine. These deposits had to be flushed from the engine to avoid the possibility of explosion during engine handling and future firing. TCE was used to flush the engine's fuel system immediately before and after each test firing. The flushing procedure involved pumping TCE through the engine's fuel system and letting the solvent overflow for a period ranging from several seconds to 30\u201335 minutes, depending upon the engine. For some engines, the engine's gas generator and liquid oxygen (LOX) dome were also flushed with TCE before test firing.  The F-1 rocket engine had its LOX dome, gas generator, and thrust chamber fuel jacket flushed with TCE during launch preparations.\n\nRefrigerants: TCE is also used in the manufacture of a range of fluorocarbon refrigerants such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane more commonly known as HFC 134a. TCE was also used in industrial refrigeration applications due to its high heat transfer capabilities and its low-temperature specification.\n\nSafety: \n\nChemical instability: Despite its widespread use as a metal degreaser, trichloroethylene itself is unstable in the presence of metal over prolonged exposure. As early as 1961 this phenomenon was recognized by the manufacturing industry when stabilizing additives were added to the commercial formulation. Since the reactive instability is accentuated by higher temperatures, the search for stabilizing additives was conducted by heating trichloroethylene to its boiling point under a reflux condenser and observing decomposition. Definitive documentation of 1,4-dioxane as a stabilizing agent for TCE is scant due to the lack of specificity in early patent literature describing TCE formulations. Epichlorohydrin, butylene oxide, N-methylpyrrole and ethyl acetate are common stabilisers for TCE, with epichlorohydrin being the most persistent and effective. Other chemical stabilizers include ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone.\n\nPhysiological effects: When inhaled, trichloroethylene produces central nervous system depression resulting in general anesthesia. These effects may be mediated by trichloroethylene acting as a positive allosteric modulator of inhibitory GABAA and glycine receptors. Its high blood solubility results in a less desirable slower induction of anesthesia. At low concentrations, it is relatively non-irritating to the respiratory tract. Higher concentrations result in tachypnea. Many types of cardiac arrhythmias can occur and are exacerbated by epinephrine (adrenaline). It was noted in the 1940s that TCE reacted with carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbing systems (soda lime) to produce dichloroacetylene by dehydrochlorination and phosgene. Cranial nerve dysfunction (especially the fifth cranial nerve) was common when TCE anesthesia was given using CO2 absorbing systems. Muscle relaxation with TCE anesthesia sufficient for surgery was poor. For these reasons as well as problems with hepatotoxicity, TCE lost popularity in North America and Europe to more potent anesthetics such as halothane by the 1960s.\nThe symptoms of acute non-medical exposure are similar to those of alcohol intoxication, beginning with headache, dizziness, and confusion and progressing with increasing exposure to unconsciousness. Much of what is known about the chronic human health effects of trichloroethylene is based on occupational exposures. Besides the effects to the central nervous system, workplace exposure to trichloroethylene has been associated with toxic effects in the liver and kidney. A history of long-term exposure to high concentrations of trichloroethylene is a suspected environmental risk of Parkinson's disease.\n\nMetabolism: Trichloroethylene is metabolised to trichloroepoxyethane (TCE oxide) which rapidly isomerises to trichloroacetaldehyde (chloral). Chloral hydrates to chloral hydrate in the body. Chloral hydrate is either reduced to 2,2,2-trichloroethanol or oxidised to trichloroacetic acid. Monochloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid and trichloromethane were also detected as minor metabolites of TCE.\n\nExposure and regulations: With a specific gravity greater than 1 (denser than water), trichloroethylene can be present as a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) if sufficient quantities are spilt in the environment, as it sinks below water without dissolving. \nThe first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available American federal and state surveys, between 9% and 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the US may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies comply with the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 5 ppb.\nGenerally, atmospheric levels of TCE are highest in areas of concentrated industry and population. Atmospheric levels tend to be lowest in rural and remote regions. Average TCE concentrations measured in air across the United States are generally between 0.01 ppb and 0.3 ppb, although mean levels as high as 3.4 ppb have been reported. TCE levels in the low parts per billion range have been measured in food; however, levels as high as 140 ppb were measured in a few samples of food.\n\nExisting regulations: State, federal, and international agencies classify trichloroethylene as a known or probable carcinogen for humans. In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer updated its classification of trichloroethylene to Group 1, indicating that sufficient evidence exists that it can cause cancer of the kidney in humans as well as some evidence of cancer of the liver and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nIn the European Union, the Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values (SCOEL) recommends an exposure limit for workers exposed to trichloroethylene of 10 ppm (54.7 mg/m3) for 8-hour TWA and of 30 ppm (164.1 mg/m3) for STEL (15 minutes).\nExisting EU legislation aimed at protection of workers against risks to their health (including Chemical Agents Directive 98/24/EC and Carcinogens Directive 2004/37/EC) currently do not impose binding minimum requirements for controlling risks to workers' health during the use phase or throughout the life cycle of trichloroethylene.\nIn 2023, the United States United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that trichloroethylene presents a risk of injury to human health in various uses, including during manufacturing, processing, mixing, recycling, vapor degreasing, as a lubricant, adhesive, sealant, cleaning product, and spray. As of June 1, 2023, two U.S. states (Minnesota and New York) have acted on the EPA's findings and banned trichloroethylene in all cases but research and development. According to the US EPA, in October 2023 it \"proposed to ban the manufacture (including import), processing, and distribution in commerce of TCE for all uses, with longer compliance time frames and workplace controls (including an exposure limit) for some processing and industrial and commercial uses until the prohibitions come into effect\" to \"protect everyone including bystanders from the harmful health effects of TCE\".\n\nRemediation: Recent research has focused on the in-place remediation of trichloroethylene in soil and groundwater using potassium permanganate instead of removal for off-site treatment and disposal. Naturally occurring bacteria have been identified with the ability to degrade TCE. Dehalococcoides sp. degrade trichloroethylene by reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, Pseudomonas fluorescens can co-metabolize TCE. Soil and groundwater contamination by TCE has also been successfully remediated by chemical treatment and extraction. The bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea can degrade a variety of halogenated compounds including trichloroethylene. Toluene dioxygenase has been reported to be involved in TCE degradation by Pseudomonas putida. In some cases, Xanthobacter autotrophicus can convert up to 51% of TCE to CO and CO2.\n\nSociety and culture: Groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge including trichloroethylene is a major concern for human health and has precipitated numerous incidents and lawsuits in the United States.\nThe 1995 non-fiction book A Civil Action was written about a lawsuit (Anderson v. Cryovac) against following the increase in cancer cases after trichloroethylene pollution incidents and it was adapted to cinema in 1998.\nTCE has been used as a recreational drug. Common methods of taking trichloroethylene recreationally include inhalation from a rag (similar to taking an inhalational anaesthetic) and drinking. Most TCE abusers were young people and workers who use the chemical in their workplace. The main reason for abuse is TCE's euphoriant and slight hallucinogenic effect. Some workers had become addicted to TCE.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). 1997.

It is used mainly as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts, but it is also an ingredient in adhesives, paint removers, typewriter correction fluids, and spot removers. Trichloroethylene is not thought to occur naturally in the environment. However, it has been found in underground water sources and many surface waters as a result of the manufacture, use, and disposal of the chemical.\nTrichloroethylene can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts. It can cause developmental toxicity and male reproductive toxicity according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nTrichloroethylene appears as a clear colorless volatile liquid having a chloroform-like odor. Denser than water and is slightly soluble in water. Noncombustible. Used as a solvent, fumigant, in the manufacture of other chemicals, and for many other uses.\nTrichloroethene is a member of the class of chloroethenes that is ethene substituted by chloro groups at positions 1, 1 and 2. It has a role as an inhalation anaesthetic and a mouse metabolite.\nTrichloroethylene is a halocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent, not to be confused with the similar 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as chlorothene. It has been sold under a variety of trade names including Trimar and Trilene and used as a volatile anesthetic and as an inhaled obstetrical analgesic. Environmental exposure, particularly groundwater and drinking water contamination from industrial discharge, is a major concern for human health and has been the subject of numerous incidents and lawsuits.\nMost of the trichloroethylene used in the United States is released into the atmosphere from industrial degreasing operations. Acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to trichloroethylene can affect the human central nervous system (CNS), with symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, confusion, euphoria, facial numbness, and weakness. Liver, kidney, immunological, endocrine, and developmental effects have also been reported in humans. A recent analysis of available epidemiological studies reports trichloroethylene exposure to be associated with several types of cancers in humans, especially kidney, liver, cervix, and lymphatic system. Animal studies have reported increases in lung, liver, kidney, and testicular tumors and lymphoma. The Agency is currently reassessing the cancer classification of trichloroethylene.\nTrichloroethylene has been reported in Bos taurus and Caenorhabditis elegans with data available.\nTrichloroethylene is a synthetic, light sensitive, volatile, colorless, liquid that is miscible with many non-polar organic solvents. Trichloroethylene is used mainly as a degreaser for metal parts. Upon combustion, it produces irritants and toxic gases. Occupational exposure to trichloroethylene is associated with excess incidences of liver cancer, kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen. (NCI05)\nTRICHLOROETHYLENE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV.\nTrichloroethylene is a solvent and extractive in the manufacture of foods. One recent review of the epidemiology of kidney cancer rated cigarette smoking and obesity as more important risk factors for kidney cancer than exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene. In contrast, the most recent overall assessment of human health risks associated with trichloroethylene states, [t]here is concordance between animal and human studies, which supports the conclusion that trichloroethylene is a potential kidney carcinogen. The evidence appears to be less certain at this time regarding the relationship between humans and liver cancer observed in mice, with the NAS suggesting that low-level exposure might not represent a significant liver cancer risk in the general population. The chemical compound trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon commonly used as an industrial solvent. It is a clear non-flammable liquid with a sweet smell. The first known report of TCE in groundwater was given in 1949 by two English public chemists who described two separate instances of well contamination by industrial releases of TCE. Based on available federal and state surveys, between 9% to 34% of the drinking water supply sources tested in the U.S. may have some TCE contamination, though EPA has reported that most water supplies are in compliance with the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 5 ppb. In addition, a growing concern in recent years at sites with TCE contamination in soil or groundwater has been vapor intrusion in buildings, which has resulted in indoor air exposures, such is in a recent case in the McCook Field Neighborhood of Dayton, Ohio. Trichloroethylene has been detected in 852 Superfund sites across the United States, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, and as amended annual water quality testing is required for all public drinking water distributors. The EPA'S current guidelines for TCE can be found here. It should be noted that the EPA's table of TCE Releases to Ground is dated 1987 to 1993, thereby omitting one of the largest Superfund Cleanup sites in the nation, the NIBW in Scottsdale, Arizona. The TCE released here occurred prior to its appearance in the municipal drinking wells in 1982. This reaction can be catalyzed by a variety of substances. The most commonly used catalyst is a mixture of potassium chloride and aluminum chloride. However, various forms of porous carbon can also be used. This reaction produces tetrachloroethylene as a byproduct, and depending on the amount of chlorine fed to the reaction, tetrachloroethylene can even be the major product. Typically, trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are collected together and then separated by distillation.Trichloroethylene: Parkinsonism and complex 1 mitochondrial neurotoxicity). Trichloroethylene is an effective solvent for a variety of organic materials.\n\nTrichloroethylene belongs to the family of Organochlorides. These are organic compounds containing a chlorine atom.\nA highly volatile inhalation anesthetic used mainly in short surgical procedures where light anesthesia with good analgesia is required. It is also used as an industrial solvent. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of the vapor can lead to cardiotoxicity and neurological impairment.\nsafety: Irritant and Health Hazard\nsmiles: C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl\nforumla: C2HCl3\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 131.38 g/mol\nXLogP3: 2.6\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 0\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 0\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\nExact Mass: 129.914383 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 129.914383 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 0\nHeavy Atom Count: 5\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 42.9\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",
        "text2": "Title: 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane\nwikipedia: 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA), also known by the brand names Bonoform, Cellon and Westron, is an organic compound. It is colorless liquid and has a sweet odor. It is used as an industrial solvent and as a separation agent. TeCA is toxic and it can be inhaled, consumed or absorbed through the skin. After exposure, nausea, dizziness or even liver damage may occur.\n\nHistory: 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane were discovered by Auguste Laurent in 1836.\n1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane was used in large amounts to produce other chemicals like trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and 1,2-dichloroethylene.\nBecause of its possible carcinogen effects on humans, the production of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane has decreased significantly and is no longer widely used as an end-product. It is however still generated as a byproduct and as an intermediate product during manufacturing, where low levels of the chemical have been detected in the air.\n\nUses: 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has been used as an industrial solvent since the 1910s when it was widely used in cellulose acetate \"dope\" formulations, under the name \"Cellon\". Its use in dope formulations decreased towards the 1920s as its toxicity became more known.\nOther uses for the substance include paint stripping, acting as a denaturation agent for alcohol, as a solvent for waxes & varnishes, and in the extraction of oils and degreasing of metals.\n1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane is currently used as a feedstock in the production of 1,2-dichloroethylene,trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene.\n\nSynthesis: There are a few different ways to synthesise 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane can be produced by the catalytic addition of chlorine to acetylene (ethyne) which yields the highest purity. It is also produced by direct chlorination or oxychlorination utilizing ethylene as feedstock and by catalytic chlorination of ethane or chlorination of 1,2- dichloroethane. 1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane is always produced in closed systems to obtain the highest yield. Common side products that are created during the synthesis of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane are 1,2-Dichloroethane and trichloroethylene (in the presence of heat).\n\nToxicity: Alcohol increases the metabolism of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA) and it will intensify the effects of TeCA. Humans who consume alcohol might be at an increased risk for all toxic effects from TeCA. This is also a case for several other chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons. An investigation showed when you combine alcohol with TeCA it increases the relative weight of the experimented rats, indicating an enlarged activity of TeCA.\n\nMetabolism: The metabolism is believed to involve cytochrome (CYP) P450. Experiments showed that biotransformation reactions increased with chronic ethanol consumption and fasting.\n\nMechanism of action: 1,1,2,2,-Tetrachloroethane (TeCA) can be rapidly and extensively absorbed from oral and inhalation exposure. In animal studies the oral take up was reported as 70-100% and 40-97% oral uptake in human inhalation. TeCA is a small, volatile, lipophilic molecule; TeCA can be readily absorbed from respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Absorption with passive diffusion is the most likely mechanism.\nAfter TeCA is absorbed in the body, it is readily distributed throughout the body via passive diffusion. TeCA will most likely accumulate in lipid-rich tissues, such as the liver. Urinary elimination occurs as metabolites, including formic acid, glyoxalic acid, trichloroacetic acid and trichloroethanol.\nAlready mentioned before passive diffusion is an important mechanism, because it is most likely the major mechanism of excretion.\nTeCA metabolism to reactive products plays a key role in the toxicity of TeCA. In rats, microsomal and nuclear cytochrome P450 enzymes are implicated in the metabolism with TeCA, releasing biologically active compounds as; aldehydes, alkenes, acids and free radicals. Formation of active metabolites is likely the mechanism for the toxicity.\nMechanism for neurological effects is not yet determined and therefore can not be described, TeCA might play a role. The property of the readily passive diffusion to lipid-rich tissues allows it to interfere with neural membrane function, central nervous system depression, behavioral changes and anesthesia. but there are no studies of TeCA's mechanism of neuronal effects.\nMode of action in TeCA's carcinogenic effect is not completely determined. Several studies of TeCA have reported increases in the number of hepatocytes in mitosis, but the role these effects might have of TeCA on carcinogenicity is not evaluated. It suggests that TeCA may have promoting and initiating activity.\n\nToxicokinetics: The most common health effect was found to be on the liver following 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA) exposure. The studies for this have been divided into the four different Toxicokinetic phases: Adsorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion (ADME). Three exposure routes have been studied to examine the effects depending on the entry route of TeCA into the body.\n\nOral exposure:  The experiment for the oral exposure was done by administering oral doses of radioactively labeled TeCA by gavage in corn oil to rats and mice. Followed by measuring the radioactivity in the expired air and urine.  a) Adsorption:  With a measured radioactivity of 65%-73% the conclusion made was that the compound is almost completely absorbed orally.    b) Distribution:  Hepatic protein binding was observed by purifying the liver protein. Furthermore, adverse effects were seen in liver, kidney and testes leading to the conclusion that TeCA is distributed to these tissues.     c) Metabolism:  see experiments on Metabolism routes d) Excretion:  After 72h more than 90% of the dose was excreted in metabolized or unchanged form. The largest part was excreted in breath followed by urine and the least amount of TeCA was recovered in feces. 20%-30% were retained in skin and carcass.\nInhalation exposure:  The experiment on the health effects following inhalation exposure was performed on human volunteers for adsorption and excretion studies and on animals for distribution and metabolism. A bulb containing 38C1-labeled TeCA was inserted into their mouths and the volunteers inhaled deeply, held their breath for 20 seconds, and exhaled. The excretion of the radiolabeled TeCA was measured.    a) Adsorption:  The results of the study showed that 97% TeCA was adsorbed in a single breath.    b) Distribution:  After exposure to mice and rats via inhalation adverse effects were observed in liver and kidney indicating a systemic distribution of TeCA to these tissues.     c) Metabolism:   Following 6 hours of inhalation exposure the level of radioactively labeled TeCA was measured at a concentration of 7.73% non metabolized in expired air. 72 hours later 1.78% was measured.     d) Excretion:  One hour after exposure 3% of inhaled TeCA was measured in excreted breath and 0.015% in urine.\nDermal exposure:  To measure the health effects following dermal exposure were performed 1mL of TeCA was applied to the skin of mice and guinea pigs.   a) Adsorption:  Within one half hour the dose was absorbed into the skin.   b) Distribution:  No experiments available.   c) Metabolism:  No experiments available   d) Excretion:  The half-life of TeCA in blood was shown to be approximately two hours.\n\nHealth effects: 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TeCA) has a vast array of effects spread throughout the whole body. Effects have been investigated on different systems on both humans and animals, stated respectively.\n\nGastrointestinal Effects: 4 studies on humans after TeCA exposure determined gastrointestinal distress in the participants. Two humans exposed to 2.9 ppm TeCA for 30 minutes showed symptoms of vomiting and nausea. These symptoms also caused weight loss.\nA study by Horiuchi et al. showed that a monkey frequently exposed to 1.9 ppm TeCA got anorexic and developed regular diarrhea.\n\nHematological Effects: Workers in an artificial silk factory that had regularly inhaled TeCA, showed elevated white blood cell levels and slight anemia.\nIn 1962, a study showed that 2\u20443 of the investigated rats exposed to 9000 ppm TeCA for 29 days had decreased red blood cells and hemoglobin levels.\n\nHepatic Effects: Autopsies on humans who died due to TeCA exposure showed that some humans developed hepatic failure from the TeCA, they showed jaundice and an enlarged liver. The liver is the most affected system with TeCA poisoning, causing for example apoptosis of the liver tissue.\nAfter 60 ppm exposure rats show fatty liver degeneration. Another study determined the limit for acute hepatic failure to be at 102ppm for four hours, indicated by increases in hepatic ascorbic acid and serum glutamate dehydrogenase and decreases in serum triglycerides.\n\nOcular Effects: The vapors of TeCA can cause eye irritation, stinging, squinting and lacrimation in both humans and animals. This is due to direct contact of the skin and vapor rather than inhalation or digestion.\n\nNeurological effects: Inhalation of TeCA vapor can cause dizziness, headache and tremors.\nAcute symptoms in rats showed in the form of 50% motor loss when exposed to 360ppm for one hour.\n\nCarcinogenic Effects: The National Cancer Institute performed experiments on the tumorigenicity of TeCA in rats and mice via the oral exposure route. Liver tumors were found in both species. Other studies on the tumorigenic mode of action revealed that it acts both as initiator and promoter.\n\nLethal dose: Due to several case study reports on individuals who died after ingesting TeCA, the approximate lethal dose was possible to be established. Since the amount consumed varied this was difficult to exactly determine. One report was shown to be 4100 mg/kg, the second 357 mg/kg and the third 1100\u20139600 mg/kg. Death following the ingestion occurred within 3\u201320 hours.\n\nSee also: 1,1,1,2-Tetrachloroethane\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\n1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane is a manufactured, colorless, dense liquid that does not burn easily.

Low levels have been detected in air. The main effects of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane are liver and neurological effects. Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure to very high levels of 1,1,2,2- tetrachloroethane has resulted in effects on the liver and respiratory, central nervous, and gastrointestinal systems in humans. Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane in humans results in jaundice and an enlarged liver, headaches, tremors, dizziness, numbness, and drowsiness. Animal studies have shown a significantly increased incidence of liver tumors in mice orally exposed to 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane. EPA has classified 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane as a Group C possible human carcinogen.\n1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane has been reported in Cystoseira barbata with data available.\n1,1,2,2-Tetrachloroethane is a chlorinated derivative of ethane.

It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents.  It is widely used as a herbicide and organic chemistry building block.\n\nMechanism of action: It has herbicidal properties killing young seedlings of both monocot and dicot species.  DCBN interferes with cellulose synthesis.  DCBN adapted cell walls use minimal amounts of cellulose, instead relying on Ca2+-bridge pectates.\n\nSafety: In 1971 in the U.S. State of California, their department of agriculture reported, \"Dichlobenil kills the roots of many species, but not all; further, the killing does not extend much beyond the portion actually soaked.\"\n\nIn 1996, the University of California's Statewide Integrated Pest Management Project reported:  Dosages were difficult to control... and as a result soaking or spraying methods are no longer used.      The current application method involves applying metam-sodium products in foam carriers (similar to shaving cream).\nThe U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA, a major operational division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services) mentions \"dichlobenil\" in a report entitled \"Herbicidal suppression of bracken and effects on forage production.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Energy - Bonneville Power Administration has reported \"high potential\" for dichlobenil to enter groundwater.\n\nResidue: According to the US Environmental Protection Agency,\n\nOn an acute basis, dichlobenil is practically nontoxic to birds, mammals, honey bees; slightly to moderately toxic to aquatic invertebrates and estuarine organisms; and moderately toxic to fish. Dichlobenil is practically nontoxic to birds on a subacute dietary basis, but insufficient data are available to assess chronic avian toxicity. Dichlobenil is toxic to non-target terrestrial and aquatic plants. Dichlobenil may chronically affect fish at levels as low as 0.33 ppm and may chronically affect aquatic invertebrates at levels as low as 0.75 ppm. The dichlobenil degradate, BAM is slightly toxic to mammals and\npractically nontoxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates on an acute basis.\nInland Fisheries Ireland has reported, \"The dichlobenil residue in water almost completely dissipates in 5 to 6 months.\"\nU.S. FDA reports on pesticide residue.\n\nToxicity and environment: Since 1995, the U.S. National Institutes of Health has warned about potential damage to humans during indoor usage (see products listed, below):  Leave all windows open and fans operating...

        "text1": "Title: 3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran\nwikipedia: 3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran (3-OH THF) is a colorless liquid with a normal boiling point of 179 \u00b0C and boiling at 88\u221289 \u00b0C at 17 mmHg, with density (1.087 g/cm3 at 19 \u00b0C). 3-OH THF is a useful pharmaceutical intermediate.  The enantiopure (absolute configuration S) version of this compound is an intermediate to launched retroviral drugs.\n\nSynthesis: 3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran was prepared in 1910 by Pariselle via cyclization and hydrolysis of 3,4-Dibromo-1-methoxybutane. Chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran (both (S) \u2013 and (R)-forms) has been synthesized in high enantiomeric purity from (S)- and (R)-1,2,4-butanetriol, respectively, obtained from chiral feedstocks. Thus, the chiral (S)-1,2,4-butanetriol intermediate was cyclized to chiral (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) catalyst at temperatures of 180\u2212220 \u00b0C.  \nSimilarly, (S)-3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran was prepared in 95.8% optical purity from L-malic acid via an esterification-reduction-cyclodehydration sequence. 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran has been synthesized via hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofuran employing various borane reagents and chiral 3-hydroxytetrahydrofurans have also been prepared by catalytic asymmetric hydroboration of 2,3- and 2,5-dihydrofurans with a borane in the presence of a homogeneous chiral platinum complex, followed by oxidation. Racemic 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran may be prepared in analogous fashion from racemic butanetriol, employing PTSA catalyst for the dehydrocyclization. Alternatively, 1,2,4-butanetriol may be converted to 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran by treating with ethylene carbonate, followed by pyrolysis of the resulting carbonate ester.\n\nApplications: 3-Hydroxytetrahydrofuran is an intermediate to the AIDS drugs amprenavir and fosamprenavir. Additionally, 3-OH THF has been an intermediate to developmental drug substances, such as chemotherapy agents. For example, reaction of phosphorus pentasulfide with 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran has been used in the synthesis of bis(O,O-di(tetrahydrofuran-3-yl)hydrogen dithiophosphate)platinum(II), a cisplatin analog. 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran may be converted into a range of tetrahydrofuran derivatives, many of which also serve as intermediates to compounds of pharmaceutical interest. For example, tetrahydrofuran-3-one (3-ketotetrahydrofuran) and 3-aminotetrahydrofuran have been synthesized from 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran and used in pharmaceutical syntheses. Additionally, additive amounts (0.05-0.15 weight %) of the nitrate ester manufactured by sulfuric acid-nitric acid nitration of 3-hydoxytetrahydrofuran have been found to increase the quality (cetane number) of diesel fuel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nsafety: Irritant\nsmiles: C1COCC1O\nforumla: C4H8O2\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 88.11 g/mol\nXLogP3: -0.4\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 1\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 2\nRotatable Bond Count: 0\nExact Mass: 88.052429494 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 88.052429494 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 29.5\nHeavy Atom Count: 6\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 44.8\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 1\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text1": "Title: Palmitoylethanolamide\nwikipedia: Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide, and lipid modulator.\nA main target of PEA is proposed to be the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-\u03b1). PEA also has affinity to cannabinoid-like G-coupled receptors GPR55 and GPR119. PEA cannot strictly be considered a classic endocannabinoid because it lacks affinity for the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2.\n\nEarly and recent studies: In 1975, Czech physicians described the results of a clinical trial looking at  joint pain, where the analgesic action of aspirin versus PEA was tested; both drugs were reported to enhance joint movements and decrease pain. In 1970 the drug manufacturer Spofa in Czechoslovakia introduced Impulsin, a tablet dose of PEA, for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory infections. In Spain, the company Almirall introduced Palmidrol in tablet and suspension forms in 1976, for the same indications. \nIn the mid-1990s, the relationship between anandamide and PEA was described; the expression of mast cell receptors sensitive to the two molecules was demonstrated by Levi-Montalcini and coworkers. During this period, more insight into the functions of endogenous fatty acid derivatives emerged, and compounds such as oleamide, palmitoylethanolamide, 2-lineoylglycerol and 2-palmitoylglycerol were explored for their capacity to modulate pain sensitivity and inflammation via what at that time was thought to be the endocannabinoid signalling pathway.\nPrimary reports also have provided evidence that PEA downregulates hyperactive mast cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that it alleviates pain elicited in mouse models. PEA and related compounds such as anandamide also seem to have synergistic effects in models of pain and analgesia.\n\nAnimal models: In a variety of animal models, PEA seems to have some promise; researchers have been able to demonstrate relevant clinical efficacy in a variety of disorders, from multiple sclerosis to neuropathic pain.\nIn the mouse forced swimming test, palmitoylethanolamide was comparable to fluoxetine for depression. An Italian study published in 2011 found that PEA reduced the raised intraocular pressure of glaucoma. In a spinal trauma model, PEA reduced the resulting neurological deficit via the reduction of mast cell infiltration and activation. PEA in this model also reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its activity as an inhibitor of inflammation counteracts reactive astrogliosis induced by beta-amyloid peptide, in a model relevant for neurodegeneration, probably via the PPAR-\u03b1 mechanism of action. In models of stroke and other CNS trauma, PEA exerted neuroprotective properties.\n\nAnimal models of chronic pain and inflammation: Chronic pain and neuropathic pain are indications for which there is high unmet need in the clinic. PEA has been tested in a variety of animal models for chronic and neuropathic pain, because cannabinoids, such as THC, have been proven to be effective in neuropathic pain states. The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of PEA in two models of acute and persistent pain seemed to be explained at least partly via the de novo neurosteroid synthesis. In chronic granulomatous pain and inflammation model, PEA could prevent nerve formation and sprouting, mechanical allodynia, and PEA inhibited dorsal root ganglia activation, which is a hallmark for winding up in neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of PEA as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory molecule is probably based on different aspects. PEA inhibits the release of both preformed and newly synthesised mast cell mediators, such as histamine and TNF-alpha. PEA, as well as its analogue adelmidrol (di-amide derivative of azelaic acid), can both down-regulate mast cells. PEA reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and prevents IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, the latter related to PEA as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist.\nIn 2012 it became clear that PEA can also reduce reperfusion injury and the negative impact of shock on various outcome parameters, such as renal dysfunction, ischemic injury and inflammation, most probably via the PPAR-alpha pathway. Studies have shown that PEA activates PPAR-alpha and TRPV1 receptors that control inflammation and the sensation of pain. Among the reperfusion and inflammation markers measured PEA could reduce the increase in creatinine, \u03b3GT, AST, nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baBp65; kidney MPO activity and MDA levels, nitrotyrosine, PAR and adhesion molecules expression, the infiltration and activation of mast cells and apoptosis.\nThe biological responses to PEA dosing in animal models and in humans are being investigated vis-\u00e0-vis its involvement in a repair mechanism relevant to patient conditions of chronic inflammation and chronic pain. In a model of visceral pain (inflammation of the urinary bladder) PEA was able to attenuate the viscero-visceral hyper-reflexia induced by inflammation of the urinary bladder, one of the reasons why PEA is currently explored in the painful bladder syndrome. In a different model for bladder pain, the turpentine-induced urinary bladder inflammation in the rat, PEA also attenuated a referred hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent way. Chronic pelvic pain in patients seem to respond favourably to a treatment with PEA.\n\nActivity in non-neuronal cells: PEA, as an N-acylethanolamine, has physico-chemical properties comparable to anandamide, and, while it is not strictly an endocannabinoid, it is often studied in conjunction with anandamide because of their overlapping synthetic and metabolic pathways. N-acylethanolamines such as PEA often act as signaling molecules, activating receptors and regulating a variety of physiological functions. PEA is known to activate intracellular, nuclear and membrane-associated receptors, and to regulate many physiological functions related to the inflammatory cascade and chronic pain states. Endocannabinoid lipids like PEA are widely distributed in nature, in a variety of plant, invertebrate, and mammalian tissues.\nPEA's mechanism of action sometimes is described as Autacoid Local Injury Antagonism (acronym ALIA), and PEA under this nomenclature is an ALIAmide. Levi-Montalcini and coworkers presented evidence in 1993 that lipid amides of the N-acylethanolamine type, such as PEA, are potential prototypes of naturally occurring molecules capable of modulating mast cell activation, and her group used the acronym ALIA in that report. An autocoid is a regulating molecule, locally produced. An ALIAmide is an autocoid synthesized on-demand in response to injury, and acts locally to counteract such pathology. Soon after the breakthrough paper of Levi-Montalcini, the mast cell appeared to be an important target for the anti-inflammatory activity of PEA. Since 1993, at least 25 papers have been published on the various effects of PEA on mast cells. These cells are often found in proximity to sensory nerve endings, and their degranulation can enhance the nociceptive signal, the reason why peripheral mast cells are considered to be pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive. PEA's activity is currently seen as a new inroad in the treatment of neuropathic pain and related disorders based on overactivation of glia and glia-related cells, such as in diabetes and glaucoma. Microglia plays a key role in the winding up phenomenon and central sensitization.\n\nClinical relevance: Effects of oral dosing of PEA has been explored in humans, and include clinical trials for a variety of pain states, for inflammatory and pain syndromes. Daily doses range from 300 to 1200 mg per day. In a 2017 systematic meta-analysis involving 10 studies including data from 786 patients receiving PEA for pain-related indications and 512 controls, PEA was found to be associated with pain reduction significantly greater than observed in controls (P < 0.001). Positive influences have also been observed in dermal applications, specifically atopic eczema, which may be linked to PPAR alpha activation. \nIn a 2015 analysis of a double blind placebo controlled study of PEA in sciatic pain, the Numbers Needed to Treat was 1.5. Its positive influence in chronic pain, and inflammatory states such as atopic eczema, seems to originate mainly from PPAR alpha activation. Since 2012 a number of new trials have been published, among which studies in glaucoma. PEA also seems to be one of the factors responsible for the decrease in pain sensitivity during and after sport, comparable to the endogenous opiates (endorphines).\nFrom a clinical perspective the most important and promising indications for PEA are linked to neuropathic and chronic pain states, such as diabetic neuropathic pain, sciatic pain, CRPS, pelvic pain and entrapment neuropathic pain states. In a blind trial reported in a conference proceeding, patients affected by pain from synovitis or TMJ osteoarthritis (N=25, in total) were randomly assigned to PEA or ibuprofen groups for two weeks; the decrease in pain reported after two weeks was significantly higher for the PEA-treated group, likewise for improved masticatory function. In 2012, 20 patients with thalidomide and bortezomib induced neuropathy were reported to have improved nerve functions and less pain after a two-month treatment with PEA. The authors pointed out that although a placebo effect might play a role in the reported pain relief, the changes in neurophysiological measures clearly indicated that PEA exerted a positive action on the myelinated fibre groups. Sixteen men and fourteen women with two major types of neuropathic pain refractory to analgesic treatment\u2014peripheral diabetic neuropathy (4 men, 7 women) or post-herpetic neuralgia (12 men, 7 women)\u2014whose symptoms spanned eight pain categories (\"burning\", \"osteoarticular\", \"piercing\", etc.) who were under prior treatment with pregabalin were transferred to PEA, after which pregabalin treatment was gradually reintroduced; all were responding well after 45 days, and presented significant decreases in pain scores (without drug-drug interactions).\nIn 2013, a metareview was published on the clinical efficacy and safety of PEA in the treatment of the common cold and influenza, based on reports from six double-blind, placebo, randomized controlled trials, addressing PEA's proposed anti-inflammatory and retinoprotectant effects.\nIn 2019, significant increases in fatty acid amides including PEA, arachidonoylethanolamide, and oleoylethanolamide were noted in a Scottish woman with a previously undocumented variant of congenital insensitivity to pain. This was found to be a result of  a combination of a hypomorphic single nucleotide polymorphism of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), alongside a mutation of the pseudogene, FAAH-OUT. The pseudogene was previously considered to be non-coding DNA, FAAH-OUT was found to be capable of modulating the expression of FAAH, making it a possible future target for novel analgesia/anxiolytic drug development.\nIn 2020, PEA has been suggested as a drug that may prove beneficial for the treatment of lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. A pharmaceutical company called FSD Pharma have entered PEA into a Phase 1 clinical trial under the name FSD-201, and has approval from the FDA for progressing to Phase 2a for this indication.\n\nMetabolism: PEA is metabolized by the cellular enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase (NAAA), the latter of which has more specificity toward PEA over other fatty acid amides.\n\nSafety: PEA is generally considered safe, and without adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or drug interactions. A 2016 study assessing safety claims in sixteen clinical trials, six case reports/pilot studies and a meta\u2010analysis of PEA as an analgesic, concluded that for treatment periods up to 49 days, clinical data argued against serious ADRs at an incidence of 1/200 or greater. A 2016 pooled meta-analysis involving twelve studies found that no serious ADRs were registered and/or reported. No data on interactions with PEA have been reported. Based on its mechanism, PEA may be considered likely to interact with other PPAR-\u03b1 agonists used to treat high triglycerides; this remains unconfirmed.\n\nSee also: N-Acylethanolamine\nN-Acylphosphatidylethanolamine\n\nReferences: \n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nPalmitoyl ethanolamide is an N-(long-chain-acyl)ethanolamine that is the ethanolamide of palmitic (hexadecanoic) acid.

        "text2": "Title: Monoethanolamine\nwikipedia: Ethanolamine (2-aminoethanol, monoethanolamine, ETA, or MEA) is a naturally occurring organic chemical compound with the formula HOCH2CH2NH2 or C2H7NO. The molecule is bifunctional, containing both a primary amine and a primary alcohol. Ethanolamine is a colorless, viscous liquid with an odor reminiscent of ammonia.\nEthanolamine is commonly called monoethanolamine or MEA in order to be distinguished from diethanolamine (DEA) and triethanolamine (TEOA). The ethanolamines comprise a group of amino alcohols. A class of antihistamines is identified as ethanolamines, which includes carbinoxamine, clemastine, dimenhydrinate, chlorphenoxamine, diphenhydramine and doxylamine.\n\nHistory: Ethanolamines, or in particular, their salts, were discovered by Charles Adolphe Wurtz in 1860 by heating 2-chloroethanol with ammonia solution while studying derivatives of ethylene oxide he discovered a year earlier. He wasn't able to separate the salts or isolate any free bases.\nIn 1897 Ludwig Knorr developed the modern industrial route (see below) and separated the products, including MEA, by fractional distillation, for the first time studying their properties.\nNone of the ethanolamines were of any commercial importance until after the WWII industrial production of ethylene oxide took off.\n\nOccurrence in nature: MEA molecules are a component in the formation of cellular membranes and are thus a molecular building block for life. Ethanolamine is the second-most-abundant head group for phospholipids, substances found in biological membranes (particularly those of prokaryotes); e.g., phosphatidylethanolamine. It is also used in messenger molecules such as palmitoylethanolamide, which has an effect on CB1 receptors.\nMEA was thought to exist only on Earth and on certain asteroids, but in 2021 evidence was found that these molecules exist in interstellar space. \nEthanolamine is biosynthesized by decarboxylation of serine:\n\nHOCH2CH(CO2H)NH2 \u2192 HOCH2CH2NH2 + CO2\nDerivatives of ethanolamine are widespread in nature; e.g., lipids, as precursor of a variety of N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), that modulate several animal and plant physiological processes such as seed germination, plant\u2013pathogen interactions, chloroplast development and flowering, as well as precursor, combined with arachidonic acid C20H32O2 20:4, \u03c9-6), to form the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4, \u03c9-6).\nMEA is biodegraded by ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, a B12-dependent enzyme.  It is converted to acetaldehyde and ammonia via initial H-atom abstraction.\n\nH2NCH2CH2OH   \u2192   NH3  +  CH3CHO\n\nIndustrial production: Monoethanolamine is produced by treating ethylene oxide with aqueous ammonia; the reaction also produces diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The ratio of the products can be controlled by the stoichiometry of the reactants.\n\nApplications: MEA is used as feedstock in the production of detergents, emulsifiers, polishes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitors, and chemical intermediates.\nFor example, reacting ethanolamine with ammonia gives ethylenediamine, a precursor of the commonly used chelating agent, EDTA.\n\nGas stream scrubbing: Monoethanolamines can scrub combusted-coal, combusted-methane and combusted-biogas flue emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) very efficiently. MEA carbon dioxide scrubbing is also used to regenerate the air on submarines.\nSolutions of MEA in water are used as a gas stream scrubbing liquid in amine treaters. For example, aqueous MEA is used to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from various gas streams; e.g., flue gas and sour natural gas. The MEA ionizes dissolved acidic compounds, making them polar and considerably more soluble.\nMEA scrubbing solutions can be recycled through a regeneration unit. When heated, MEA, being a rather weak base, will release dissolved H2S or CO2 gas resulting in a pure MEA solution.\n\nOther uses: In pharmaceutical formulations, MEA is used primarily for buffering or preparation of emulsions. MEA can be used as pH regulator in cosmetics.\nIt is an injectable sclerosant as a treatment option of symptomatic hemorrhoids. 2\u20135 ml of ethanolamine oleate can be injected into the mucosa just above the hemorrhoids to cause ulceration and mucosal fixation thus preventing hemorrhoids from descending out of the anal canal.\nIt is also an ingredient in cleaning fluid for automobile windshields.\n\npH-control amine: Ethanolamine is often used for alkalinization of water in steam cycles of power plants, including nuclear power plants with pressurized water reactors. This alkalinization is performed to control corrosion of metal components. ETA (or sometimes a similar organic amine; e.g., morpholine) is selected because it does not accumulate in steam generators (boilers) and crevices due to its volatility, but rather distributes relatively uniformly throughout the entire steam cycle. In such application, ETA is a key ingredient of so-called \"all-volatile treatment\" of water (AVT).\n\nReactions: Upon reaction with carbon dioxide, 2 equivalents of ethanolamine react through the intermediacy of carbonic acid to form a carbamate salt, which when heated usually reforms back to ethanolamine and carbon dioxide but occasionally can also cyclizate to 2-oxazolidone, generating amine gas treatment wastes.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Process technology to produce ethanolamines by reaction of ammonia and ethylene oxide\nCDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards\n\n\n pubchem:\nEthanolamine appears as a clear colorless liquid with an odor resembling that of ammonia.

The MEA ionizes dissolved acidic compounds, making them polar and considerably more soluble."

Like many alcohols, it is a water-soluble, colourless liquid.  It is more toxic than typical small alcohols. Allyl alcohol is used as a precursor to many specialized compounds such as flame-resistant materials, drying oils, and plasticizers.  Allyl alcohol is the smallest representative of the allylic alcohols.\n\nProduction: Allyl alcohol is produced commercially by the Olin and Shell corporations through the hydrolysis of allyl chloride:\n\nCH2=CHCH2Cl + NaOH  \u2192  CH2=CHCH2OH + NaCl\nAllyl alcohol can also be made by the rearrangement of propylene oxide, a reaction that is catalyzed by potassium alum at high temperature. The advantage of this method relative to the allyl chloride route is that it does not generate salt. Also avoiding chloride-containing intermediates is the \"acetoxylation\" of propylene to allyl acetate:\n\nCH2=CHCH3 + 1/2 O2 + CH3CO2H  \u2192  CH2=CHCH2O2CCH3 + H2O\nHydrolysis of this acetate gives allyl alcohol. In alternative fashion, propylene can be oxidized to acrolein, which upon hydrogenation gives the alcohol.\nIn principle, allyl alcohol can be obtained by dehydrogenation of propanol.\n\nLaboratory methods: In the laboratory, glycerol reacts with oxalic or formic acids to give (respectively) dioxalin or glyceric formate, either of which decarboxylate and dehydrate to allylol.\nAllyl alcohols in general are prepared by allylic oxidation of allyl compounds, using selenium dioxide or organic peroxides. Other methods include carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions such as the Prins reaction, the Morita-Baylis-Hillman reaction, or a variant of the Ramberg-B\u00e4cklund reaction. Hydrogenation of enones is another route.  Some of these methods are achieved by the Luche reduction, Wharton reaction, and the Mislow-Evans rearrangement.\nAllyl alcohol was first prepared in 1856 by Auguste Cahours and August Hofmann by hydrolysis of allyl iodide. Today a\nAllyl alcohol can be formed after trituration of garlic (Allium sativum) cloves (producing from garlic in two ways: firstly by a self-condensation reaction of allicin and its decomposition products such as  diallyl trisulphide and diallyl disulphide and secondly by the reaction between alliin, the precursor of allicin, and water).\n\nApplications: Allyl alcohol is converted mainly to glycidol, which is a chemical intermediate in the synthesis of glycerol, glycidyl ethers, esters, and amines. Also, a variety of polymerizable esters are prepared from allyl alcohol, e.g. diallyl phthalate.\nAllyl alcohol has herbicidal activity and can be used as a weed eradicant) and fungicide.\nAllyl alcohol is the precursor in the commercial synthesis of allyl bromide: \n\nCH2=CHCH2OH + HBr \u2192 CH2=CHCH2Br + H2O\n\nSafety: Allyl alcohol is hepatotoxic. In rats, in vivo, allyl alcohol is metabolized by liver alcohol dehydrogenase to acrolein, which can cause damage to the microtubules of rat hepatocyte mitochondria and depletion of glutathione. It is significantly more toxic than related alcohols.  Its threshold limit value (TLV) is 2 ppm.  It is a lachrymator.\n\nSee also: Propargyl alcohol\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: International Chemical Safety Card 0095\nNIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards. \"#0017\".

        "text2": "Title: Ethosuximide\nwikipedia: Ethosuximide, sold under the brand name Zarontin among others, is a medication used to treat absence seizures. It may be used by itself or with other antiseizure medications such as valproic acid. Ethosuximide is taken by mouth.\nEthosuximide is usually well tolerated. Common side effects include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, low blood cell levels, and lupus erythematosus. It is unclear if it has adverse effects on the fetus during pregnancy. Ethosuximide is in the succinimide family of medications. Its mechanism of action is thought to be due to antagonism of the postsynaptic T-type voltage-gated calcium channel.\nEthosuximide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ethosuximide is available as a generic medication. As of 2019, its availability was limited in many countries, with concerns about price fixing in the United States.\n\nMedical uses: Ethosuximide is approved for absence seizures, and is considered the first choice medication for treating them, in part because it lacks the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of the alternative anti-absence drug, valproic acid.\n\nAdverse effects: As with other anticonvulsants, ethosuximide carries a warning about use during pregnancy. Although a causal relationship with birth defects has not be established, the potential for harm to the baby is weighed against the known harm caused by a mother having even minor seizures.\n\nCentral nervous system: \n\nCommon: drowsiness\nmental confusion\ninsomnia\nheadache\nataxia\n\nRare: paranoid psychosis\nincreased libido\nexacerbation of depression\n\nGastrointestinal: dyspepsia\nvomiting\nnausea\ncramps\nconstipation\ndiarrhea\nstomach pain\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\ngum enlargement\nswelling of tongue\nabnormal liver function\n\nGenitourinary: microscopic hematuria\nvaginal bleeding\n\nBlood: The following can occur with or without bone marrow loss:\n\npancytopenia\nagranulocytosis\nleukopenia\neosinophilia\n\nSkin: urticaria\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nStevens\u2013Johnson syndrome\nhirsutism\npruritic erythematous rashes\n\nEyes: myopia\n\nDrug interactions: Valproates can either decrease or increase the levels of ethosuximide; however, combinations of valproates and ethosuximide had a greater protective index than either drug alone.\nIt may elevate serum phenytoin levels.\n\nMechanism of action: The mechanism by which ethosuximide affects neuronal excitability includes block of T-type calcium channels, and may include effects of the drug on other classes of ion channel. The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms. Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels may have contributed to reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness.\nIn March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince showed that ethosuximide and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June of that same year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that. The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 \u03bcmol/L to 1 mmol/L.\nThat same year, however, Herrington and Lingle found no such effect at concentrations of up to 2.5 mmol/L. The year after, a study conducted on human neocortical cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, the first to use human tissue, found that ethosuximide had no effect on Ca2+ currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect.\nIn 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University reported a 100% block of T-type current in dorsal root ganglia at 23.7 \u00b1 0.5 mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported. That same year, Leresche et al. reported that ethosuximide had no effect on T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating Na+ current by 60% and the Ca2+-activated K+ currents by 39.1 \u00b1 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na+ current is responsible for the anti-absence properties.\nIn the introduction of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels. Using cloned \u03b11G, \u03b11H, and \u03b11I T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an IC50 of 12 \u00b1 2 mmol/L and that of N-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of mesuximide) is 1.95 \u00b1 0.19 mmol/L for \u03b11G, 1.82 \u00b1 0.16 mmol/L for \u03b11I, and 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/L for \u03b11H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.\n\nStereochemistry: Ethosuximide is a chiral drug with a stereocenter. Therapeutically, the racemate, the 1: 1 mixture of ( S ) and ( R ) - isomers used.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nCost: As of 2019 there were concerns in the United States that the price of ethosuximide was inflated by manufacturers.\n\nAvailability: Availability of ethosuximide is limited in many countries. It was marketed under the trade names Emeside and Zarontin. However, both capsule preparations were discontinued from production, leaving only generic preparations available. Emeside capsules were discontinued by their manufacturer, Laboratories for Applied Biology, in 2005. Similarly, Zarontin capsules were discontinued by Pfizer in 2007. Syrup preparations of both brands remained available.\n\nSee also: Phensuximide\nMethsuximide\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nEthosuximide is a dicarboximide that is pyrrolidine-2,5-dione in which the hydrogens at position 3 are substituted by one methyl and one ethyl group.

This leads to a decrease in burst firing of thalamocortical neurons, which stabilizes the nerve activity in the brain and prevents seizures.\nETHOSUXIMIDE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1960 and is indicated for epilepsy and has 7 investigational indications.\nEthosuximide is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is an anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures. [PubChem]Binds to T-type voltage sensitive calcium channels. Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1G gives rise to T-type calcium currents. T-type calcium channels belong to the low-voltage activated (LVA) group and are strongly blocked by mibefradil. A particularity of this type of channels is an opening at quite negative potentials and a voltage-dependent inactivation. T-type channels serve pacemaking functions in both central neurons and cardiac nodal cells and support calcium signaling in secretory cells and vascular smooth muscle. They may also be involved in the modulation of firing patterns of neurons which is important for information processing as well as in cell growth processes.\nAn anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures.\nsafety: Irritant\nsmiles: CCC1(CC(=O)NC1=O)C\nforumla: C7H11NO2\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 141.17 g/mol\nXLogP3: 0.4\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 1\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 2\nRotatable Bond Count: 1\nExact Mass: 141.078978594 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 141.078978594 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 46.2\nHeavy Atom Count: 10\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 188\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 1\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text2": "Title: Troglitazone\nwikipedia: Troglitazone is an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory drug, and a member of the drug class of the thiazolidinediones. It was prescribed for people with diabetes mellitus type 2.  \nIt was patented in 1983 and approved for medical use in 1997. It was subsequently withdrawn.\n\nMechanism of action: Troglitazone, like the other thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone), works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs).\nTroglitazone is a ligand to both PPAR\u03b1 and \u2013 more strongly \u2013 PPAR\u03b3. Troglitazone also contains an \u03b1-Tocopherol moiety, potentially giving it vitamin E-like activity in addition to its PPAR activation. It has been shown to reduce inflammation. Troglitazone use was associated with a decrease of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) and a concomitant increase in its inhibitor (I\u03baB). NF\u03baB is an important cellular transcription regulator for the immune response.\n\nHistory: Troglitazone was developed by Daiichi Sankyo (Japan). In the United States, it was introduced and manufactured by Parke-Davis in the late 1990s but turned out to be associated with an idiosyncratic reaction leading to drug-induced hepatitis. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medical officer assigned to evaluate troglitazone, John Gueriguian, did not recommend its approval due to potentially high liver toxicity; Parke-Davis complained to the FDA, and Gueriguian was subsequently removed from his post. A panel of experts approved it in January 1997.  Once the prevalence of adverse liver effects became known, troglitazone was withdrawn from the British market in December 1997, from the United States market in 2000, and from the Japanese market soon afterwards. It did not get approval in the rest of Europe.\nTroglitazone was developed as the first anti-diabetic drug having a mechanism of action involving the enhancement of insulin resistance.  At the time, it was widely believed that such drugs, by addressing the primary metabolic defect associated with Type 2 diabetes, would have numerous benefits including avoiding the risk of hypoglycemia associated with insulin and earlier oral antidiabetic drugs.  It was further believed that reducing insulin resistance would potentially reduce the very high rate of cardiovascular disease that is associated with diabetes.\nParke-Davis/Warner Lambert submitted the diabetes drug Rezulin for FDA review on July 31, 1996. The medical officer assigned to the review, Dr. John L. Gueriguian, cited Rezulin's potential to harm the liver and the heart, and he questioned its viability in lowering blood sugar for patients with adult-onset diabetes, recommending against the drug's approval. After complaints from the drugmaker, Gueriguian was removed on November 4, 1996, and his review was purged by the FDA. Gueriguian and the company had a single meeting at which Gueriguian used \"intemperate\" language; the company said its objections were based on inappropriate remarks made by Gueriguian. Parke-Davis said at the advisory committee that the risk of liver toxicity was comparable to placebo and that additional data of other studies confirmed this. According to Peter G\u00f8tzsche, when the company provided these additional data one week after approval, they showed a substantially greater risk for liver toxicity.\nThe FDA approved the drug on January 29, 1997, and it appeared in pharmacies in late March. At the time, Dr. Solomon Sobel, a director at the FDA overseeing diabetes drugs, said in a New York Times interview that adverse effects of troglitazone appeared to be rare and relatively mild.\nGlaxo Wellcome received approval from the British Medicines Control Agency (MCA) to market troglitazone, as Romozin, in July 1997. After reports of sudden liver failure in patients receiving the drug, Parke-Davis and the FDA added warnings to the drug label requiring monthly monitoring of liver enzyme levels. Glaxo Wellcome removed troglitazone from the market in Britain on December 1, 1997. Glaxo Wellcome had licensed the drug from Sankyo Company of Japan and had sold it in Britain from October 1, 1997.\nOn May 17, 1998, a 55-year-old patient named Audrey LaRue Jones died of acute liver failure after taking troglitazone. Importantly, she had been monitored closely by physicians at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a participant in the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) diabetes prevention study. This called into question the efficacy of the monitoring strategy. The NIH responded on June 4 by dropping troglitazone from the study. Dr. David J. Graham, an FDA epidemiologist charged with evaluating the drug, warned on March 26, 1999 of the dangers of using it and concluded that patient monitoring was not effective in protecting against liver failure. He estimated that the drug could be linked to over 430 liver failures and that patients incurred 1,200 times greater risk of liver failure when taking Rezulin. Dr. Janet B. McGill, an endocrinologist who had assisted in the Warner\u2013Lambert's early clinical testing of Rezulin, wrote in a March 1, 2000 letter to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.): \"I believe that the company... deliberately omitted reports of liver toxicity and misrepresented serious adverse events experienced by patients in their clinical studies.\"\nOn March 21, 2000, the FDA withdrew the drug from the market. Dr. Robert I. Misbin, an FDA medical officer, wrote in a March 3, 2000 letter to Senator John Ashcroft of strong evidence that Rezulin could not be used safely. He was later threatened by the FDA with dismissal.  By that time, the drug had been linked to 63 liver-failure deaths and had generated sales of more than $2.1 billion for Warner-Lambert. The drug cost $1,400 a year per patient in 1998. Pfizer, which had acquired Warner-Lambert in February 2000, reported the withdrawal of Rezulin cost $136 million.\n\nMechanisms of hepatotoxicity: Since the withdrawal in 2000, mechanisms of troglitazone hepatotoxicity have been extensively studied using a variety of in vivo, in vitro, and computational methods.  These studies have suggested that hepatotoxicity of troglitazone results from a combination of metabolic and nonmetabolic factors.  The nonmetabolic toxicity is a complex function of drug-protein interactions in the liver and biliary system.  Initially, the metabolic toxicity was largely associated with reactive metabolite formation from the thiazolidinedione and chromane rings of troglitazone.  Moreover, the formation of quinone and o-quinone methide reactive metabolites were proposed to be formed by metabolic oxidation of the hydroxy group (OH group) of the chromane ring.   Detailed quantum chemical analysis of the metabolic pathways for troglitazone has shown that quinone reactive metabolite is generated by oxidation of the OH group, but o-quinone methide reactive metabolite is formed by the oxidation of the methyl groups (CH3 groups) ortho to the OH group of the chromane ring.  This understanding has been recently used in the design of novel troglitazone derivatives with antiproliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines.\n\nLawsuits: In 2009, Pfizer resolved all but three of 35,000 claims over its withdrawn diabetes drug Rezulin for a total of about $750 million. Pfizer, which acquired rival Wyeth for almost $64 billion, paid about $500 million to settle Rezulin cases consolidated in federal court in New York, according to court filings. The company also paid as much as $250 million to resolve state-court suits. In 2004, it set aside $955 million to end Rezulin cases.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \"Troglitazone\".

        "text1": "Title: Semustine\nwikipedia: Semustine (1- (2-Chloroethyl)-3-(trans-4-methylcyclohexyl)- 1-nitrosourea, MeCCNU) is an alkylating nitrosourea compound used in chemotherapy treatment of various types of tumours. Due to its lipophilic property, semustine can cross the blood-brain barrier for the chemotherapy of brain tumours, where it interferes with DNA replication in the rapidly-dividing tumour cells.\nSemustine, just as lomustine, is administered orally.\nEvidence has been found that treatment with semustine can cause acute leukaemia as a delayed effect in very rare cases.\n\nStructure and reactivity: Semustine (Me-CCNU) is an organochlorine compound that is urea in which the two hydrogens on one of the amino groups are replaced by nitroso and 2-chloroetyl groups and one hydrogen from the other amino group is replaced by a 4-methylcyclohexcyl group. Semustine is also known as a 4-methyl derivative of lomustine.\n\nSynthesis: The synthesis of semustine originates from a systematic synthesis scheme revolving around N-Nitrosourea compounds. Phosgene is reacted with Aziridine to produce the chemical intermediate di(aziridin-1-yl) methanone. This reacts with the subsequently released HCl from the production of the intermediate to open the Aziridine rings and it will form 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-urea. The next step is to nitrosate this compound with the sodium nitrite in formic acid. This will give one of the nitrogen\u2019s a nitroso functional group. With this step carmustine (BCNU), another medication used for chemotherapy, is formed. BCNU is subsequently decomposed in the presence of 4-Methylcyclohexylamine. The aliphatic amine is in two equivalents present during the decomposition. During the decomposition, the compound loses its nitroso group and only one methyl cyclohexyl group will be found on the compound. The final step is to repeat the nitrosation of the compound under the same conditions and Semustine (Me-CCNU) is synthesised. This whole synthesis is shown in Figure 1.\nMore recent studies suggest using 1-chloro-2-isocyanatoethyl as a starting material alongside cyclohexylamine. For this, TEA can be used as a catalyst to get to the same final step as the previously mentioned synthesis route. In this final step, the nitrosation can be done again with sodium nitrite (1) or with tert-Butyl nitrite (2). In this synthesis R = H, CH3 or OH. This whole synthesis is shown in Figure 2.\n\nAvailable forms: Since the synthesis yields a stable substance, this compound is usually delivered as pure substance and not as a salt. When supplied as medicine, the most common forms of administration are pills with a range from 3.0 to 100 mg semustine per pill.\n\nMechanism of action: DNA is the most significant part of the cell, performing the most important processes, replication, and transcription. These processes and DNA itself can be targeted with small molecules or ligands with possible antitumor activity, resulting in prevention of continuous growth and proliferating of cancer cells. The common property of alkylating agents, including semustine, is their capacity to become very strong electrophiles through the formation of (chloro-) carbonium ion intermediates, which are products of the hydrolysis of the semustine drug. This reaction yields covalent cross-links between various nucleophilic DNA bases by alkylation, causing denaturation of the double helix  and inhibiting separation of the DNA strand. By this mechanism, semustine interferes with rapidly proliferating cells and exerts its anti-tumour effects. Targets of the interstrand cross-link forming are specifically the N-7 of guanine, O-6 of adenine and other sites on the purine bases. This is depicted in Figure 3.\nThe electrophilic property of semustine increases under acidic conditions, which makes the nucleophilic attack occur much faster. In general, acidic pH conditions cause a significant increase in the reaction rate of the semustine drug.\n\nMetabolism: After oral administration and absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, semustine undergoes rapid chemical decomposition and oxidative metabolism. Due to the lipophilic nature of semustine, the distribution is quickly across the tissue. Semustine is metabolised by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) mono-oxygenase system on the cyclohexyl ring carbons and the 2-chloroethyl sidechain resulting hydroxylated metabolites, which remains alkylating and anti-tumour active. Most of the biological effect is due to the generation of the chloroethyl carbonium ion from the ring hydroxylated metabolite. Ring hydroxylation occurs during the \u201cfirst pass\u201d through the gut wall and liver.\nThe metabolites and decomposition products are excreted by the kidneys into the urine.  Up to 60% of the dose is excreted by urine within 48 hours. The decomposition products present in the urine are cis-3-hydroxy-trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine, trans-4-methylcyclohexylamine, trans-4-hydroxymethylcyclohexylamine and trans-3-hydroxy-trans-4-methyl-cyclohexylamine. These are shown in Figure 4.\n\nIndications: Nitrosoureas such as semustine frequently cause nausea and vomiting, after admission (4 to 6 hours). The major toxic effects of semustine are thrombocytopenia and leukopenia caused by cumulative doses. Secondly the nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of the semustine cause pulmonary fibrosis and renal dysfunction. Semustine nephrotoxicity is cumulative, the cumulative dose at which nephrotoxicity is likely to occur has been estimated to be near 2,000 mg/m2. This problem generally appears only in patients being treated for more than 1 year, which requires a prolonged survival time.\n\nEfficacy and side effects: \n\nEfficacy: Semustine was used to treat several different types of cancers. The main one was L1210 leukaemia and Hodgkin lymphoma. Other types are metastatic brain tumours, Lewis lung tumours, cancers of the digestive tract, lymphoma, malignant melanoma, and epidermoid carcinoma of the lung.\nIt has however not shown desired results as an antineoplastic drug and thus has never been approved for it. Combinations with other drugs have also been done in the 70\u2019s but have not shown more beneficial results. In China, research is still done on the compound. These however also state the need for further investigation and possible different combinations of antineoplastic drugs to get a higher rate of complete response and overall survival after treatment.\n\nAdverse effects: During the trials of semustine, sufficient evidence was found that semustine is a carcinogen. During a trail of 2067 patients, 14 cases of acute leukaemia were found. This was combined with a roughly 4% chance to acquire leukaemia disorder within six years. This trail was done on patients with gastrointestinal cancer and before the use of this antineoplastic drug, there were no recorded cases in the medical history of Connecticut that these combinations of cancer occur. This could be derived back to the start of the nitrosourea chemotherapy. Providing quantitative evidence that semustine is a carcinogen. For this reason it is also added to IARC group 1 for carcinogenic agents to humans.\n\nEffects on animals: The described carcinogenicity of semustine to humans has not been found in animals, specifically mice and rats. It is however still a carcinogen. There was an increase found in peritoneal sarcoma and lung tumours, indicating a different toxicity to animals.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\n1-(2-Chloroethyl)-3-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea (Methyl-CCNU) can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\n1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-(4-methylcyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea is a light yellow powder.

        "text1": "Title: Trehalose\nwikipedia: Trehalose (from Turkish t\u0131gala \u2013 a sugar derived from insect cocoons + -ose) is a sugar consisting of two molecules of glucose.  It is also known as mycose or tremalose. Some bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrate animals synthesize it as a source of energy, and to survive freezing and lack of water.\nExtracting trehalose was once a difficult and costly process, but around 2000, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) discovered an inexpensive extraction technology from starch. Trehalose has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food, cosmetics and as a drug. A procedure developed in 2017 using trehalose allows sperm storage at room temperatures.\n\nStructure: Trehalose is a disaccharide formed by a 1,1-glycosidic bond between two \u03b1-glucose units. It is found in nature as a disaccharide and also as a monomer in some polymers. Two other stereoisomers exist: \u03b1,\u03b2-trehalose, also called neotrehalose, and \u03b2,\u03b2-trehalose, also called isotrehalose. Neither of these alternate isomers has been isolated from living organisms, but isotrehalose has been was found in starch hydroisolates.\n\nSynthesis: At least three biological pathways support trehalose biosynthesis. An industrial process can derive trehalose from corn starch.\n\nProperties: \n\nChemical: Trehalose is a nonreducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1\u20131 alpha bond, giving it the name \u03b1-D-gluco\u00adpyranosyl-(1\u21921)-\u03b1-D-gluco\u00adpyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore is stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The bonding keeps nonreducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation).  Trehalose is less soluble than sucrose, except at high temperatures (>80 \u00b0C). Trehalose forms a rhomboid crystal as the dihydrate, and has 90% of the calorific content of sucrose in that form. Anhydrous forms of trehalose readily regain moisture to form the dihydrate. Anhydrous forms of trehalose can show interesting physical properties when heat-treated.\nTrehalose aqueous solutions show a concentration-dependent clustering tendency. Owing to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, they self-associate in water to form clusters of various sizes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that concentrations of 1.5\u20132.2 molar allow trehalose molecular clusters to percolate and form large and continuous aggregates.\nTrehalose directly interacts with nucleic acids, facilitates melting of double stranded DNA and stabilizes single-stranded nucleic acids.\n\nBiological: Organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and lower and higher plants have enzymes that can make trehalose.\nIn nature, trehalose can be found in plants, and microorganisms.  In animals, trehalose is prevalent in shrimp, and also in insects, including grasshoppers, locusts, butterflies, and bees, in which trehalose serves as blood-sugar. Trehalase genes are found in tardigrades, the microscopic ecdysozoans found worldwide in diverse extreme environments.\nTrehalose is the major carbohydrate energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible reason for this is that the glycosidic linkage of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one glycosidic linkage releases only one glucose molecule.\nIn plants, trehalose is seen in sunflower seeds, moonwort, Selaginella plants, and sea algae. Within the fungi, it is prevalent in some mushrooms, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes), oyster, king oyster, and golden needle.\nEven within the plant kingdom, Selaginella (sometimes called the resurrection plant), which grows in desert and mountainous areas, may be cracked and dried out, but will turn green again and revive after rain because of the function of trehalose.\nThe two prevalent theories as to how trehalose works within the organism in the state of cryptobiosis are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose.\nIn bacterial cell wall, trehalose has a structural role in adaptive responses to stress such as osmotic differences and extreme temperature. Yeast uses trehalose as a carbon source in response to abiotic stresses. In humans, the only known function of trehalose is as a neuroprotective, which it accomplishes by inducing autophagy and thereby clearing protein aggregates.\nTrehalose has also been reported for anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory (in vitro and in vivo) activities, upon its esterification with fatty acids of varying chain lengths.\n\nNutritional and dietary properties: Trehalose is rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which is present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores.:\u200a135\u200a It causes less of a spike in blood sugar than glucose.  Trehalose has about 45% the sweetness of sucrose at concentrations above 22%, but when the concentration is reduced, its sweetness decreases more quickly than that of sucrose, so that a 2.3% solution tastes 6.5 times less sweet as the equivalent sugar solution.:\u200a444\u200a\nIt is commonly used in prepared frozen foods, like ice cream, because it lowers the freezing point of foods.\nDeficiency of trehalase enzyme is unusual in humans, except in the Greenlandic Inuit, where it is present in only 10\u201315% of the population.:\u200a197\n\nMetabolism: Five biosynthesis pathways have been reported for trehalose. The most common pathway is TPS/TPP pathway which is used by organisms that synthesize trehalose using the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase (TPS). Second, trehalose synthase (TS) in certain types of bacteria could produce trehalose by using maltose and another disaccharide with two glucose units as substrates. Third, the TreY-TreZ pathway in some bacteria converts starch that contain maltooligosaccharide or glycogen directly into trehalose. Fourth, in primitive bacteria, trehalose glycisyltransferring synthase (TreT) produces trehalose from ADP-glucose and glucose. Fifth, trehalose phosphorylase (TreP) either hydrolyses trehalose into glucose-1-phosphate and glucose or may act reversibly in certain species. Vertebrates do not have the ability to synthesize or store trehalose. Trehalase in humans is found only in specific location such as the intestinal mucosa, renal brush-border, liver and blood. Expression of this enzyme in vertebrates is initially found during the gestation period that is the highest after weaning. Then, the level of trehalase remained constant in the intestine throughout life. Meanwhile, diets consisting of plants and fungi contain trehalose. Moderate amount of trehalose in diet is essential and having low amount of trehalose could result in diarrhea, or other intestinal symptoms.\n\nMedical use: Trehalose is an ingredient, along with hyaluronic acid, in an artificial tears product used to treat dry eye. Outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile were initially associated with trehalose, but this finding was disputed in 2019.\nIn 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3).\n\nHistory: In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye,  and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from Trehala manna, a substance made by weevils and named it trehalose.\nTrehalose has long been known as an autophagy inducer that acts independently of mTOR. In 2017, research was published showing that trehalose induces autophagy by activating TFEB, a protein that acts as a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway.\n\nSee also: Biostasis\nCryoprotectant\nCryptobiosis\nFreeze drying\nLentztrehalose\nTrehalosamine\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links:  Media related to Trehalose at Wikimedia Commons\nTrehalose in sperm preservation\n\n\n pubchem:\nAlpha,alpha-trehalose is a trehalose in which both glucose residues have alpha-configuration at the anomeric carbon.

        "text2": "Title: D-Glucose\nwikipedia: Glucose is a sugar with the molecular formula C6H12O6. It is overall the most abundant monosaccharide, a subcategory of carbohydrates. It is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight. It is used by plants to make cellulose, the most abundant carbohydrate in the world, for use in cell walls, and by all living organisms to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy.\nIn energy metabolism, glucose is the most important source of energy in all organisms. Glucose for metabolism is stored as a polymer, in plants mainly as amylose and amylopectin, and in animals as glycogen. Glucose circulates in the blood of animals as blood sugar. The naturally occurring form is d-glucose, while its stereoisomer l-glucose is produced synthetically in comparatively small amounts and is less biologically active. Glucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form. Glucose is naturally occurring and is found in its free state in fruits and other parts of plants. In animals, it is released from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis.\nGlucose, as intravenous sugar solution, is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is also on the list in combination with sodium chloride (table salt).\nThe name glucose is derived from Ancient Greek \u03b3\u03bb\u03b5\u1fe6\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (gle\u00fbkos) 'wine, must', from \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03cd\u03c2 (glyk\u00fds) 'sweet'. The suffix -ose is a chemical classifier denoting a sugar.\n\nHistory: Glucose was first isolated from raisins in 1747 by the German chemist Andreas Marggraf. Glucose was discovered in grapes by another German chemist \u2013 Johann Tobias Lowitz \u2013 in 1792, and distinguished as being different from cane sugar (sucrose). Glucose is the term coined by Jean Baptiste Dumas in 1838, which has prevailed in the chemical literature. Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 proposed the term dextrose (from the Latin dexter, meaning \"right\"), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, l-fructose (usually referred to as d-fructose) (a ketohexose) and l-glucose (l-glucose) turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (d and l-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the d- and l-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of d- or l-glyceraldehyde.\nSince glucose is a basic necessity of many organisms, a correct understanding of its chemical makeup and structure contributed greatly to a general advancement in organic chemistry. This understanding occurred largely as a result of the investigations of Emil Fischer, a German chemist who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his findings. The synthesis of glucose established the structure of organic material and consequently formed the first definitive validation of Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff's theories of chemical kinetics and the arrangements of chemical bonds in carbon-bearing molecules. Between 1891 and 1894, Fischer established the stereochemical configuration of all the known sugars and correctly predicted the possible isomers, applying Van 't Hoff equation of asymmetrical carbon atoms. The names initially referred to the natural substances. Their enantiomers were given the same name with the introduction of systematic nomenclatures, taking into account absolute stereochemistry (e.g. Fischer nomenclature, d/l nomenclature).\nFor the discovery of the metabolism of glucose Otto Meyerhof received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1922. Hans von Euler-Chelpin was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Arthur Harden in 1929 for their \"research on the fermentation of sugar and their share of enzymes in this process\". In 1947, Bernardo Houssay (for his discovery of the role of the pituitary gland in the metabolism of glucose and the derived carbohydrates) as well as Carl and Gerty Cori (for their discovery of the conversion of glycogen from glucose) received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. In 1970, Luis Leloir was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of glucose-derived sugar nucleotides in the biosynthesis of carbohydrates.\n\nChemical and physical properties: Glucose forms white or colorless solids that are highly soluble in water and acetic acid but poorly soluble in methanol and ethanol. They melt at 146 \u00b0C (295 \u00b0F) (\u03b1) and 150 \u00b0C (302 \u00b0F) (beta),  decompose starting at 188 \u00b0C (370 \u00b0F) with release of various volatile products, ultimately leaving a residue of carbon. Glucose has a pKa value of 12.16 at 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) in water.\nWith six carbon atoms, it is classed as a hexose, a subcategory of the monosaccharides. d-Glucose is one of the sixteen aldohexose stereoisomers. The d-isomer, d-glucose, also known as dextrose, occurs widely in nature, but the l-isomer, l-glucose, does not. Glucose can be obtained by hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as milk sugar (lactose), cane sugar (sucrose), maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc. Dextrose is commonly commercially manufactured from starches, such as corn starch in the US and Japan, from potato and wheat starch in Europe, and from tapioca starch in tropical areas. The manufacturing process uses hydrolysis via pressurized steaming at controlled pH in a jet followed by further enzymatic depolymerization. Unbonded glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey.\nThe term dextrose is often used in a clinical (related to patient's health status) or nutritional context (related to dietary intake, such as food labels or dietary guidelines), while \"glucose\" is used in a biological or physiological context (chemical processes and molecular interactions), but both terms refer to the same molecule, specifically D-glucose. \nDextrose monohydrate is the hydrated form of D-glucose, meaning that it is a glucose molecule with an additional water molecule attached. Its chemical formula is C6H12O6 \u00b7 H2O. Dextrose monohydrate is also called hydrated D-glucose, and commonly manufactured from plant starches. Dextrose monohydrate is utilized as the predominant type of dextrose in food applications, such as beverage mixes\u2014it is a common form of glucose widely used as a nutrition supplement in production of foodstuffs. Dextrose monohydrate is primarily consumed in North America as a corn syrup or high-fructose corn syrup.\nAnhydrous dextrose, on the other hand, is glucose that does not have any water molecules attached to it.  Anhydrous chemical substances are commonly produced by eliminating water from a hydrated substance through methods such as heating or drying up (desiccation). Dextrose monohydrate can be dehydrated to anhydrous dextrose in industrial setting. Dextrose monohydrate is composed of approximately 9.5% water by mass; through the process of dehydration, this water content is eliminated to yield anhydrous (dry) dextrose.\nAnhydrous dextrose has the chemical formula C6H12O6, without any water molecule attached which is the same as glucose. Anhydrous dextrose on open air tends to absorb moisture and transform to the monohydrate, and it is more expensive to produce. Anhydrous dextrose (anhydrous D-glucose) has increased stability and increased shelf life, has medical applications, such as in oral glucose tolerance test.\nWhereas molecular weight (molar mass) for D-glucose monohydrate is 198.17 g/mol, that for anhydrous D-glucose is 180.16 g/mol The density of these two forms of glucose is also different.\nIn terms of chemical structure, glucose is a monosaccharide, that is, a simple sugar. Glucose contains six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, and is therefore an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) as well as ring (cyclic) form\u2014due to the presence of alcohol and aldehyde or ketone functional groups, the form having the straight chain can easily convert into a chair-like hemiacetal ring structure commonly found in carbohydrates.\n\nStructure and nomenclature: Glucose is present in solid form as a monohydrate with a closed pyran ring (\u03b1-D-glucopyranose monohydrate, sometimes known less precisely by dextrose hydrate). In aqueous solution, on the other hand, it is an open-chain to a small extent and is present predominantly as \u03b1- or \u03b2-pyranose, which interconvert. From aqueous solutions, the three known forms can be crystallized: \u03b1-glucopyranose, \u03b2-glucopyranose and \u03b1-glucopyranose monohydrate. Glucose is a building block of the disaccharides lactose and sucrose (cane or beet sugar), of oligosaccharides such as raffinose and of polysaccharides such as starch, amylopectin, glycogen, and cellulose. The glass transition temperature of glucose is 31 \u00b0C (88 \u00b0F) and the Gordon\u2013Taylor constant (an experimentally determined constant for the prediction of the glass transition temperature for different mass fractions of a mixture of two substances) is 4.5.\n\nOpen-chain form: A open-chain form of glucose makes up less than 0.02% of the glucose molecules in an aqueous solution at equilibrium. The rest is one of two cyclic hemiacetal forms. In its open-chain form, the glucose molecule has an open (as opposed to cyclic) unbranched backbone of six carbon atoms, where C-1 is part of an aldehyde group H(C=O)\u2212. Therefore, glucose is also classified as an aldose, or an aldohexose. The aldehyde group makes glucose a reducing sugar giving a positive reaction with the Fehling test.\n\nCyclic forms: In solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either \"D-\" or \"L-\") exists in equilibrium with several cyclic isomers, each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution, however, more than 99% of glucose molecules exist as pyranose forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25%, and furanose forms exist in negligible amounts. The terms \"glucose\" and \"D-glucose\" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular nucleophilic addition reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a hemiacetal linkage, \u2212C(OH)H\u2212O\u2212.\nThe reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered heterocyclic system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence \"-ose\") containing a derivatised pyran skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether furan. In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is \u2212(C(CH2OH)HOH)\u2212H or \u2212(CHOH)\u2212H respectively).\nThe ring-closing reaction can give two products, denoted \"\u03b1-\" and \"\u03b2-\". When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the Haworth projection, the designation \"\u03b1-\" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the \u2212CH2OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a trans arrangement), while \"\u03b2-\" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a cis arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer D-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: \u03b1-D-glucopyranose, \u03b2-D-glucopyranose, \u03b1-D-glucofuranose, and \u03b2-D-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid catalysis.\n\nThe other open-chain isomer L-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of L-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding D-glucose.\nThe glucopyranose ring (\u03b1 or \u03b2) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the \"chair\" and \"boat\" conformations of cyclohexane. Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the \"envelope\" conformations of cyclopentane.\nIn the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed.\nSome derivatives of glucofuranose, such as 1,2-O-isopropylidene-D-glucofuranose are stable and can be obtained pure as crystalline solids. For example, reaction of \u03b1-D-glucose with para-tolylboronic acid H3C\u2212(C6H4)\u2212B(OH)2 reforms the normal pyranose ring to yield the 4-fold ester \u03b1-D-glucofuranose-1,2:3,5-bis(p-tolylboronate).\n\nMutarotation: Mutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different \u2212OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium.\nThe open-chain form is thermodynamically unstable, and it spontaneously isomerizes to the cyclic forms. (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.) In solutions at room temperature, the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called mutarotation. Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of \u03b1:\u03b2 36:64. The ratio would be \u03b1:\u03b2 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the anomeric effect. Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F).\n\nOptical activity: Whether in water or the solid form, d-(+)-glucose is dextrorotatory, meaning it will rotate the direction of polarized light clockwise as seen looking toward the light source. The effect is due to the chirality of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, l-(\u2212)-glucose, is levorotatory (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five tautomers.\nThe d- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral centre has the same handedness as that of d-glyceraldehyde (which was so labelled because it is dextrorotatory). The fact that d-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centres, not just of C-5; some of the other d-aldohexoses are levorotatory.\nThe conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a polarimeter since pure \u03b1-d-glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2\u00b0 mL/(dm\u00b7g), pure \u03b2-d-glucose of +17.5\u00b0 mL/(dm\u00b7g). When equilibrium has been reached after a certain time due to mutarotation, the angle of rotation is +52.7\u00b0 mL/(dm\u00b7g). By adding acid or base, this transformation is much accelerated. The equilibration takes place via the open-chain aldehyde form.\n\nIsomerisation: In dilute sodium hydroxide or other dilute bases, the monosaccharides mannose, glucose and fructose interconvert (via a Lobry de Bruyn\u2013Alberda\u2013Van Ekenstein transformation), so that a balance between these isomers is formed. This reaction proceeds via an enediol:\n\nBiochemical properties: Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide. Glucose is also the most widely used aldohexose in most living organisms. One possible explanation for this is that glucose has a lower tendency than other aldohexoses to react nonspecifically with the amine groups of proteins. This reaction\u2014glycation\u2014impairs or destroys the function of many proteins, e.g. in glycated hemoglobin. Glucose's low rate of glycation can be attributed to its having a more stable cyclic form compared to other aldohexoses, which means it spends less time than they do in its reactive open-chain form. The reason for glucose having the most stable cyclic form of all the aldohexoses is that its hydroxy groups (with the exception of the hydroxy group on the anomeric carbon of d-glucose) are in the equatorial position. Presumably, glucose is the most abundant natural monosaccharide because it is less glycated with proteins than other monosaccharides. Another hypothesis is that glucose, being the only d-aldohexose that has all five hydroxy substituents in the equatorial position in the form of \u03b2-d-glucose, is more readily accessible to chemical reactions,:\u200a194,\u200a199\u200a for example, for esterification:\u200a363\u200a or acetal formation. For this reason, d-glucose is also a highly preferred building block in natural polysaccharides (glycans). Polysaccharides that are composed solely of glucose are termed glucans.\nGlucose is produced by plants through photosynthesis using sunlight, water and carbon dioxide and can be used by all living organisms as an energy and carbon source. However, most glucose does not occur in its free form, but in the form of its polymers, i.e. lactose, sucrose, starch and others which are energy reserve substances, and cellulose and chitin, which are components of the cell wall in plants or fungi and arthropods, respectively. These polymers, when consumed by animals, fungi and bacteria, are degraded to glucose using enzymes. All animals are also able to produce glucose themselves from certain precursors as the need arises. Neurons, cells of the renal medulla and erythrocytes depend on glucose for their energy production. In adult humans, there is about 18 g (0.63 oz) of glucose, of which about 4 g (0.14 oz) is present in the blood. Approximately 180\u2013220 g (6.3\u20137.8 oz) of glucose is produced in the liver of an adult in 24 hours.\nMany of the long-term complications of diabetes (e.g., blindness, kidney failure, and peripheral neuropathy) are probably due to the glycation of proteins or lipids. In contrast, enzyme-regulated addition of sugars to protein is called glycosylation and is essential for the function of many proteins.\n\nUptake: Ingested glucose initially binds to the receptor for sweet taste on the tongue in humans. This complex of the proteins T1R2 and T1R3 makes it possible to identify glucose-containing food sources. Glucose mainly comes from food\u2014about 300 g (11 oz) per day is produced by conversion of food, but it is also synthesized from other metabolites in the body's cells. In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during chewing by means of amylase, which is contained in saliva, as well as by maltase, lactase, and sucrase on the brush border of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. Glucosidases, a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin), and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, trehalase, and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases. They have functions in the digestion and degradation of glycogen, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, and poly(ADP-ribose). Humans do not produce cellulases, chitinases, or trehalases, but the bacteria in the gut microbiota do.\nIn order to get into or out of cell membranes of cells and membranes of cell compartments, glucose requires special transport proteins from the major facilitator superfamily. In the small intestine (more precisely, in the jejunum), glucose is taken up into the intestinal epithelium with the help of glucose transporters via a secondary active transport mechanism called sodium ion-glucose symport via sodium/glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1). Further transfer occurs on the basolateral side of the intestinal epithelial cells via the glucose transporter GLUT2, as well uptake into liver cells, kidney cells, cells of the islets of Langerhans, neurons, astrocytes, and tanycytes. Glucose enters the liver via the portal vein and is stored there as a cellular glycogen. In the liver cell, it is phosphorylated by glucokinase at position 6 to form glucose 6-phosphate, which cannot leave the cell. Glucose 6-phosphatase can convert glucose 6-phosphate back into glucose exclusively in the liver, so the body can maintain a sufficient blood glucose concentration. In other cells, uptake happens by passive transport through one of the 14 GLUT proteins. In the other cell types, phosphorylation occurs through a hexokinase, whereupon glucose can no longer diffuse out of the cell.\nThe glucose transporter GLUT1 is produced by most cell types and is of particular importance for nerve cells and pancreatic \u03b2-cells. GLUT3 is highly expressed in nerve cells. Glucose from the bloodstream is taken up by GLUT4 from muscle cells (of the skeletal muscle and heart muscle) and fat cells. GLUT14 is expressed exclusively in testicles. Excess glucose is broken down and converted into fatty acids, which are stored as triglycerides. In the kidneys, glucose in the urine is absorbed via SGLT1 and SGLT2 in the apical cell membranes and transmitted via GLUT2 in the basolateral cell membranes. About 90% of kidney glucose reabsorption is via SGLT2 and about 3% via SGLT1.\n\nBiosynthesis: In plants and some prokaryotes, glucose is a product of photosynthesis. Glucose is also formed by the breakdown of polymeric forms of glucose like glycogen (in animals and mushrooms) or starch (in plants). The cleavage of glycogen is termed glycogenolysis, the cleavage of starch is called starch degradation.\nThe metabolic pathway that begins with molecules containing two to four carbon atoms (C) and ends in the glucose molecule containing six carbon atoms is called gluconeogenesis and occurs in all living organisms. The smaller starting materials are the result of other metabolic pathways. Ultimately almost all biomolecules come from the assimilation of carbon dioxide in plants and microbes during photosynthesis.:\u200a359\u200a The free energy of formation of \u03b1-d-glucose is 917.2 kilojoules per mole.:\u200a59\u200a In humans, gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver and kidney, but also in other cell types. In the liver about 150 g (5.3 oz) of glycogen are stored, in skeletal muscle about 250 g (8.8 oz). However, the glucose released in muscle cells upon cleavage of the glycogen can not be delivered to the circulation because glucose is phosphorylated by the hexokinase, and a glucose-6-phosphatase is not expressed to remove the phosphate group. Unlike for glucose, there is no transport protein for glucose-6-phosphate. Gluconeogenesis allows the organism to build up glucose from other metabolites, including lactate or certain amino acids, while consuming energy. The renal tubular cells can also produce glucose.\nGlucose also can be found outside of living organisms in the ambient environment. Glucose concentrations in the atmosphere are detected via collection of samples by aircraft and are known to vary from location to location. For example, glucose concentrations in atmospheric air from inland China range from 0.8 to 20.1 pg/L, whereas east coastal China glucose concentrations range from 10.3 to 142 pg/L.\n\nGlucose degradation: In humans, glucose is metabolized by glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. Glycolysis is used by all living organisms,:\u200a551\u200a with small variations, and all organisms generate energy from the breakdown of monosaccharides. In the further course of the metabolism, it can be completely degraded via oxidative decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle (synonym Krebs cycle) and the respiratory chain to water and carbon dioxide. If there is not enough oxygen available for this, the glucose degradation in animals occurs anaerobic to lactate via lactic acid fermentation and releases much less energy. Muscular lactate enters the liver through the bloodstream in mammals, where gluconeogenesis occurs (Cori cycle). With a high supply of glucose, the metabolite acetyl-CoA from the Krebs cycle can also be used for fatty acid synthesis. Glucose is also used to replenish the body's glycogen stores, which are mainly found in liver and skeletal muscle. These processes are hormonally regulated.\nIn other living organisms, other forms of fermentation can occur. The bacterium Escherichia coli can grow on nutrient media containing glucose as the sole carbon source.:\u200a59\u200a In some bacteria and, in modified form, also in archaea, glucose is degraded via the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. With Glucose, a mechanism for gene regulation was discovered in E. coli, the catabolite repression (formerly known as glucose effect).\nUse of glucose as an energy source in cells is by either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration, or fermentation. The first step of glycolysis is the phosphorylation of glucose by a hexokinase to form glucose 6-phosphate. The main reason for the immediate phosphorylation of glucose is to prevent its diffusion out of the cell as the charged phosphate group prevents glucose 6-phosphate from easily crossing the cell membrane. Furthermore, addition of the high-energy phosphate group activates glucose for subsequent breakdown in later steps of glycolysis.\nIn anaerobic respiration, one glucose molecule produces a net gain of two ATP molecules (four ATP molecules are produced during glycolysis through substrate-level phosphorylation, but two are required by enzymes used during the process). In aerobic respiration, a molecule of glucose is much more profitable in that a maximum net production of 30 or 32 ATP molecules (depending on the organism) is generated.\nClick on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. \n\nTumor cells often grow comparatively quickly and consume an above-average amount of glucose by glycolysis, which leads to the formation of lactate, the end product of fermentation in mammals, even in the presence of oxygen. This is called the Warburg effect. For the increased uptake of glucose in tumors various SGLT and GLUT are overly produced.\nIn yeast, ethanol is fermented at high glucose concentrations, even in the presence of oxygen (which normally leads to respiration rather than fermentation). This is called the Crabtree effect.\nGlucose can also degrade to form carbon dioxide through abiotic means. This has been demonstrated to occur experimentally via oxidation and hydrolysis at 22 \u00b0C and a pH of 2.5.\n\nEnergy source: Glucose is a ubiquitous fuel in biology. It is used as an energy source in organisms, from bacteria to humans, through either aerobic respiration, anaerobic respiration (in bacteria), or fermentation. Glucose is the human body's key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, providing about 3.75 kilocalories (16 kilojoules) of food energy per gram. Breakdown of carbohydrates (e.g., starch) yields mono- and disaccharides, most of which is glucose. Through glycolysis and later in the reactions of the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, glucose is oxidized to eventually form carbon dioxide and water, yielding energy mostly in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The insulin reaction, and other mechanisms, regulate the concentration of glucose in the blood. The physiological caloric value of glucose, depending on the source, is 16.2 kilojoules per gram or 15.7 kJ/g (3.74 kcal/g). The high availability of carbohydrates from plant biomass has led to a variety of methods during evolution, especially in microorganisms, to utilize glucose for energy and carbon storage. Differences exist in which end product can no longer be used for energy production. The presence of individual genes, and their gene products, the enzymes, determine which reactions are possible. The metabolic pathway of glycolysis is used by almost all living beings. An essential difference in the use of glycolysis is the recovery of NADPH as a reductant for anabolism that would otherwise have to be generated indirectly.\nGlucose and oxygen supply almost all the energy for the brain, so its availability influences psychological processes. When glucose is low, psychological processes requiring mental effort (e.g., self-control, effortful decision-making) are impaired. In the brain, which is dependent on glucose and oxygen as the major source of energy, the glucose concentration is usually 4 to 6 mM (5 mM equals 90 mg/dL), but decreases to 2 to 3 mM when fasting. Confusion occurs below 1 mM and coma at lower levels.\nThe glucose in the blood is called blood sugar. Blood sugar levels are regulated by glucose-binding nerve cells in the hypothalamus. In addition, glucose in the brain binds to glucose receptors of the reward system in the nucleus accumbens. The binding of glucose to the sweet receptor on the tongue induces a release of various hormones of energy metabolism, either through glucose or through other sugars, leading to an increased cellular uptake and lower blood sugar levels. Artificial sweeteners do not lower blood sugar levels.\nThe blood sugar content of a healthy person in the short-time fasting state, e.g. after overnight fasting, is about 70 to 100 mg/dL of blood (4 to 5.5 mM). In blood plasma, the measured values are about 10\u201315% higher. In addition, the values in the arterial blood are higher than the concentrations in the venous blood since glucose is absorbed into the tissue during the passage of the capillary bed. Also in the capillary blood, which is often used for blood sugar determination, the values are sometimes higher than in the venous blood. The glucose content of the blood is regulated by the hormones insulin, incretin and glucagon. Insulin lowers the glucose level, glucagon increases it. Furthermore, the hormones adrenaline, thyroxine, glucocorticoids, somatotropin and adrenocorticotropin lead to an increase in the glucose level. There is also a hormone-independent regulation, which is referred to as glucose autoregulation. After food intake the blood sugar concentration increases. Values over 180 mg/dL in venous whole blood are pathological and are termed hyperglycemia, values below 40 mg/dL are termed hypoglycaemia. When needed, glucose is released into the bloodstream by glucose-6-phosphatase from glucose-6-phosphate originating from liver and kidney glycogen, thereby regulating the homeostasis of blood glucose concentration. In ruminants, the blood glucose concentration is lower (60 mg/dL in cattle and 40 mg/dL in sheep), because the carbohydrates are converted more by their gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids.\nSome glucose is converted to lactic acid by astrocytes, which is then utilized as an energy source by brain cells; some glucose is used by intestinal cells and red blood cells, while the rest reaches the liver, adipose tissue and muscle cells, where it is absorbed and stored as glycogen (under the influence of insulin). Liver cell glycogen can be converted to glucose and returned to the blood when insulin is low or absent; muscle cell glycogen is not returned to the blood because of a lack of enzymes. In fat cells, glucose is used to power reactions that synthesize some fat types and have other purposes. Glycogen is the body's \"glucose energy storage\" mechanism, because it is much more \"space efficient\" and less reactive than glucose itself.\nAs a result of its importance in human health, glucose is an analyte in glucose tests that are common medical blood tests. Eating or fasting prior to taking a blood sample has an effect on analyses for glucose in the blood; a high fasting glucose blood sugar level may be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes mellitus.\nThe glycemic index is an indicator of the speed of resorption and conversion to blood glucose levels from ingested carbohydrates, measured as the area under the curve of blood glucose levels after consumption in comparison to glucose (glucose is defined as 100). The clinical importance of the glycemic index is controversial, as foods with high fat contents slow the resorption of carbohydrates and lower the glycemic index, e.g. ice cream. An alternative indicator is the insulin index, measured as the impact of carbohydrate consumption on the blood insulin levels. The glycemic load is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food.\n\nPrecursor: Organisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. Starch, cellulose, and glycogen (\"animal starch\") are common glucose polymers (polysaccharides). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and chitin, which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. Oligosaccharides of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include lactose, the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and sucrose, another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and fructose. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and lipids in a process called glycosylation. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use phosphorylated glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond.\nOther than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into lipids. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C (ascorbic acid). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various metabolic pathways. Among them, all other monosaccharides such as fructose (via the polyol pathway), mannose (the epimer of glucose at position 2), galactose (the epimer at position 4), fucose, various uronic acids and the amino sugars are produced from glucose. In addition to the phosphorylation to glucose-6-phosphate, which is part of the glycolysis, glucose can be oxidized during its degradation to glucono-1,5-lactone. Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the trehalose or the dextran biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial xylose isomerase to fructose. In addition, glucose metabolites produce all nonessential amino acids, sugar alcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, fatty acids, cholesterol and nucleic acids. Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the glycosylation of proteins to glycoproteins, glycolipids, peptidoglycans, glycosides and other substances (catalyzed by glycosyltransferases) and can be cleaved from them by glycosidases.\n\nPathology: \n\nDiabetes: Diabetes is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate levels of glucose in the blood either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and insulin resistance. The pancreas is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon. Insulin is a hormone that regulates glucose levels, allowing the body's cells to absorb and use glucose. Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions. If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.\nTo monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. Blood glucose monitoring can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) \u2013 for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream.\n\nHypoglycemia management: Individuals with diabetes or other conditions that result in low blood sugar often carry small amounts of sugar in various forms. One sugar commonly used is glucose, often in the form of glucose tablets (glucose pressed into a tablet shape sometimes with one or more other ingredients as a binder), hard candy, or sugar packet.\n\nSources: Most dietary carbohydrates contain glucose, either as their only building block (as in the polysaccharides starch and glycogen), or together with another monosaccharide (as in the hetero-polysaccharides sucrose and lactose). Unbound glucose is one of the main ingredients of honey. Glucose is extremely abundant and has been isolated from a variety of natural sources across the world, including male cones of the coniferous tree Wollemia nobilis in Rome, the roots of Ilex asprella plants in China, and straws from rice in California.\n\nCommercial production: Glucose is produced industrially from starch by enzymatic hydrolysis using glucose amylase or by the use of acids. Enzymatic hydrolysis has largely displaced acid-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. The result is glucose syrup (enzymatically with more than 90% glucose in the dry matter) with an annual worldwide production volume of 20 million tonnes (as of 2011). This is the reason for the former common name \"starch sugar\". The amylases most often come from Bacillus licheniformis or Bacillus subtilis (strain MN-385), which are more thermostable than the originally used enzymes. Starting in 1982, pullulanases from Aspergillus niger were used in the production of glucose syrup to convert amylopectin to starch (amylose), thereby increasing the yield of glucose. The reaction is carried out at a pH = 4.6\u20135.2 and a temperature of 55\u201360 \u00b0C. Corn syrup has between 20% and 95% glucose in the dry matter. The Japanese form of the glucose syrup, Mizuame, is made from sweet potato or rice starch. Maltodextrin contains about 20% glucose.\nMany crops can be used as the source of starch. Maize, rice, wheat, cassava, potato, barley, sweet potato, corn husk and sago are all used in various parts of the world. In the United States, corn starch (from maize) is used almost exclusively. Some commercial glucose occurs as a component of invert sugar, a roughly 1:1 mixture of glucose and fructose that is produced from sucrose. In principle, cellulose could be hydrolyzed to glucose, but this process is not yet commercially practical.\n\nConversion to fructose: In the US, almost exclusively corn (more precisely, corn syrup) is used as glucose source for the production of isoglucose, which is a mixture of glucose and fructose, since fructose has a higher sweetening power \u2013 with same physiological calorific value of 374 kilocalories per 100 g. The annual world production of isoglucose is 8 million tonnes (as of 2011). When made from corn syrup, the final product is high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS).\n\nCommercial usage: Glucose is mainly used for the production of fructose and of glucose-containing foods. In foods, it is used as a sweetener, humectant, to increase the volume and to create a softer mouthfeel. Various sources of glucose, such as grape juice (for wine) or malt (for beer), are used for fermentation to ethanol during the production of alcoholic beverages. Most soft drinks in the US use HFCS-55 (with a fructose content of 55% in the dry mass), while most other HFCS-sweetened foods in the US use HFCS-42 (with a fructose content of 42% in the dry mass). In Mexico, on the other hand, soft drinks are sweetened by cane sugar, which has a higher sweetening power. In addition, glucose syrup is used, inter alia, in the production of confectionery such as candies, toffee and fondant. Typical chemical reactions of glucose when heated under water-free conditions are caramelization and, in presence of amino acids, the Maillard reaction.\nIn addition, various organic acids can be biotechnologically produced from glucose, for example by fermentation with Clostridium thermoaceticum to produce acetic acid, with Penicillium notatum for the production of araboascorbic acid, with Rhizopus delemar for the production of fumaric acid, with Aspergillus niger for the production of gluconic acid, with Candida brumptii to produce isocitric acid, with Aspergillus terreus for the production of itaconic acid, with Pseudomonas fluorescens for the production of 2-ketogluconic acid, with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production of 5-ketogluconic acid, with Aspergillus oryzae for the production of kojic acid, with Lactobacillus delbrueckii for the production of lactic acid, with Lactobacillus brevis for the production of malic acid, with Propionibacter shermanii for the production of propionic acid, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the production of pyruvic acid and with Gluconobacter suboxydans for the production of tartaric acid. Potent, bioactive natural products like triptolide that inhibit mammalian transcription via inhibition of the XPB subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH has been recently reported as a glucose conjugate for targeting hypoxic cancer cells with increased glucose transporter expression. Recently, glucose has been gaining commercial use as a key component of \"kits\" containing lactic acid and insulin intended to induce hypoglycemia and hyperlactatemia to combat different cancers and infections.\n\nAnalysis: When a glucose molecule is to be detected at a certain position in a larger molecule, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography analysis or lectin immunostaining is performed with concanavalin A reporter enzyme conjugate, which binds only glucose or mannose.\n\nClassical qualitative detection reactions: These reactions have only historical significance:\n\nFehling test: The Fehling test is a classic method for the detection of aldoses. Due to mutarotation, glucose is always present to a small extent as an open-chain aldehyde. By adding the Fehling reagents (Fehling (I) solution and Fehling (II) solution), the aldehyde group is oxidized to a carboxylic acid, while the Cu2+ tartrate complex is reduced to Cu+ and forms a brick red precipitate (Cu2O).\n\nTollens test: In the Tollens test, after addition of ammoniacal AgNO3 to the sample solution, glucose reduces Ag+ to elemental silver.\n\nBarfoed test: In Barfoed's test, a solution of dissolved copper acetate, sodium acetate and acetic acid is added to the solution of the sugar to be tested and subsequently heated in a water bath for a few minutes. Glucose and other monosaccharides rapidly produce a reddish color and reddish brown copper(I) oxide (Cu2O).\n\nNylander's test: As a reducing sugar, glucose reacts in the Nylander's test.\n\nOther tests: Upon heating a dilute potassium hydroxide solution with glucose to 100 \u00b0C, a strong reddish browning and a caramel-like odor develops. Concentrated sulfuric acid dissolves dry glucose without blackening at room temperature forming sugar sulfuric acid. In a yeast solution, alcoholic fermentation produces carbon dioxide in the ratio of 2.0454 molecules of glucose to one molecule of CO2. Glucose forms a black mass with stannous chloride. In an ammoniacal silver solution, glucose (as well as lactose and dextrin) leads to the deposition of silver. In an ammoniacal lead acetate solution, white lead glycoside is formed in the presence of glucose, which becomes less soluble on cooking and turns brown. In an ammoniacal copper solution, yellow copper oxide hydrate is formed with glucose at room temperature, while red copper oxide is formed during boiling (same with dextrin, except for with an ammoniacal copper acetate solution). With Hager's reagent, glucose forms mercury oxide during boiling. An alkaline bismuth solution is used to precipitate elemental, black-brown bismuth with glucose. Glucose boiled in an ammonium molybdate solution turns the solution blue. A solution with indigo carmine and sodium carbonate destains when boiled with glucose.\n\nInstrumental quantification: \n\nRefractometry and polarimetry: In concentrated solutions of glucose with a low proportion of other carbohydrates, its concentration can be determined with a polarimeter. For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a refractometer, for example in the Oechsle determination in the course of the production of wine.\n\nPhotometric enzymatic methods in solution: The enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction) of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine to a purple dye.\n\nPhotometric test-strip method: The test-strip method employs the above-mentioned enzymatic conversion of glucose to gluconic acid to form hydrogen peroxide. The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510 nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows routine blood sugar determination by nonscientists. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550 nm, 750 nm).\n\nAmperometric glucose sensor: The electroanalysis of glucose is also based on the enzymatic reaction mentioned above. The produced hydrogen peroxide can be amperometrically quantified by anodic oxidation at a potential of 600 mV. The GOx is immobilized on the electrode surface or in a membrane placed close to the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum or gold are used in electrodes, as well as carbon nanotube electrodes, which e.g. are doped with boron. Cu\u2013CuO nanowires are also used as enzyme-free amperometric electrodes, reaching a detection limit of 50 \u03bcmol/L. A particularly promising method is the so-called \"enzyme wiring\", where the electron flowing during the oxidation is transferred via a molecular wire directly from the enzyme to the electrode.\n\nOther sensory methods: There are a variety of other chemical sensors for measuring glucose. Given the importance of glucose analysis in the life sciences, numerous optical probes have also been developed for saccharides based on the use of boronic acids, which are particularly useful for intracellular sensory applications where other (optical) methods are not or only conditionally usable. In addition to the organic boronic acid derivatives, which often bind highly specifically to the 1,2-diol groups of sugars, there are also other probe concepts classified by functional mechanisms which use selective glucose-binding proteins (e.g. concanavalin A) as a receptor. Furthermore, methods were developed which indirectly detect the glucose concentration via the concentration of metabolized products, e.g. by the consumption of oxygen using fluorescence-optical sensors. Finally, there are enzyme-based concepts that use the intrinsic absorbance or fluorescence of (fluorescence-labeled) enzymes as reporters.\n\nCopper iodometry: Glucose can be quantified by copper iodometry.\n\nChromatographic methods: In particular, for the analysis of complex mixtures containing glucose, e.g. in honey, chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography are often used in combination with mass spectrometry. Taking into account the isotope ratios, it is also possible to reliably detect honey adulteration by added sugars with these methods. Derivatization using silylation reagents is commonly used. Also, the proportions of di- and trisaccharides can be quantified.\n\nIn vivo analysis: Glucose uptake in cells of organisms is measured with 2-deoxy-D-glucose or fluorodeoxyglucose. (18F)fluorodeoxyglucose is used as a tracer in positron emission tomography in oncology and neurology, where it is by far the most commonly used diagnostic agent.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nD-glucopyranose is a glucopyranose having D-configuration. It has a role as a human metabolite, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolite, an Escherichia coli metabolite and a mouse metabolite. It is a D-glucose and a glucopyranose.\nGlucose is a simple sugar (monosaccharide) generated during phosynthesis involving water, carbon and sunlight in plants. It is produced in humans via hepatic gluconeogenesis and breakdown of polymeric glucose forms (glycogenolysis). It circulates in human circulation as blood glucose and acts as an essential energy source for many organisms through aerobic or anaerobic respiration and fermentation. It is primarily stored as starch in plants and glycogen in animals to be used in various metabolic processes in the cellular level. Its aldohexose stereoisomer, dextrose or D-glucose, is the most commonly occurring isomer of glucose in nature. L-glucose is a synthesized enantiomer that is used as a low-calorie sweetener and laxative. The unspecified form of glucose is commonly supplied as an injection for nutritional supplementation or metabolic disorders where glucose levels are improperly regulated. Glucose is listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system.\nD-Glucose is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\nalpha-D-Glucose is a metabolite found in or produced by Escherichia coli (strain K12, MG1655).\nD-Glucose has been reported in Phyllanthus sellowianus, Maclura pomifera, and other organisms with data available.\nGlucose is a simple sugar monosaccharide having two isoforms, alpha and beta, with a chemical structure of C6H12O6 that acts as an energy source for both plants and animals by reacting with oxygen, generating carbon dioxide and water, and releasing energy.\nDEXTROSE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) and is indicated for varicose veins and hemorrhage and has 57 investigational indications.\nGlucose is a monosaccharide containing six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group and is therefore referred to as an aldohexose. The glucose molecule can exist in an open-chain (acyclic) and ring (cyclic) form, the latter being the result of an intramolecular reaction between the aldehyde C atom and the C-5 hydroxyl group to form an intramolecular hemiacetal. In water solution both forms are in equilibrium and at pH 7 the cyclic one is the predominant. Glucose is a primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state. In animals glucose arises from the breakdown of glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Glucose is synthesized in the liver and kidneys from non-carbohydrate intermediates, such as pyruvate and glycerol, by a process known as gluconeogenesis.\nD-Glucose is a metabolite found in or produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nA primary source of energy for living organisms. It is naturally occurring and is found in fruits and other parts of plants in its free state.

        "text2": "Title: 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine\nwikipedia: Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (abbreviated as UDMH; also known as 1,1-dimethylhydrazine, heptyl or Geptil) is a chemical compound with the formula H2NN(CH3)2 that is primarily used as a rocket propellant. At room temperature, UDMH is a colorless liquid, with a sharp, fishy, ammonia-like smell typical of organic amines. Samples turn yellowish on exposure to air and absorb oxygen and carbon dioxide. It is miscible with water, ethanol, and kerosene. At concentrations between 2.5% and 95% in air, its vapors are flammable. It is not sensitive to shock. \nSymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (1,2-dimethylhydrazine) also exists, but it is not as useful. UDMH can be oxidized in air to form many different substances, including toxic ones.\n\nSynthesis: In 1875, UDMH was first prepared by Emil Fischer, who discovered and named the class of hydrazines, by reducing N-Nitrosodimethylamine with zinc in boiling acetic acid. Fischer's student Edward Renouf later studied UDMH more extensively as part of his doctoral dissertation. Other historical lab routes include methylation of hydrazine, reduction of nitrodimethylamine and amination of dimethylamine with aminopersulfuric acid.\nUDMH is produced industrially by two routes. Based on the Olin Raschig process, one method involves reaction of monochloramine with dimethylamine giving 1,1-dimethylhydrazinium chloride:\n\n(CH3)2NH + NH2Cl \u2192 (CH3)2NNH2 \u22c5 HCl\nIn the presence of suitable catalysts, acetylhydrazine can be N-dimethylated using formaldehyde and hydrogen to give the N,N-dimethyl-N'-acetylhydrazine, which can subsequently be hydrolyzed:\n\nCH3C(O)NHNH2 + 2CH2O + 2H2 \u2192 CH3C(O)NHN(CH3)2 + 2H2O\nCH3C(O)NHN(CH3)2 + H2O \u2192 CH3COOH + H2NN(CH3)2\n\nUses: UDMH is often used in hypergolic rocket fuels as a bipropellant in combination with the oxidizer nitrogen tetroxide and less frequently with IRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid) or liquid oxygen. UDMH is a derivative of hydrazine and is sometimes referred to as a hydrazine. As a fuel, it is described in specification MIL-PRF-25604 in the United States.\nUDMH is stable and can be kept loaded in rocket fuel systems for long periods, which makes it appealing for use in many liquid rocket engines, despite its cost. In some applications, such as the OMS in the Space Shuttle or maneuvering engines, monomethylhydrazine is used instead due to its slightly higher specific impulse.\nIn some kerosene-fueled rockets, UDMH functions as a starter fuel to start combustion and warm the rocket engine prior to switching to kerosene.\nUDMH has higher stability than hydrazine, especially at elevated temperatures, and can be used as its replacement or together in a mixture. UDMH is used in many European, Russian, Indian, and Chinese rocket designs. The Russian SS-11 Sego (aka 8K84) ICBM, SS-19 Stiletto (aka 15A30) ICBM, Proton, Kosmos-3M, R-29RMU2 Layner, R-36M, Rokot (based on 15A30) and the Chinese Long March 2 are the most notable users of UDMH (which is referred to as \"heptyl\" (codename from Soviet era) by Russian engineers). The Titan, GSLV, and Delta rocket families use a mixture of 50% hydrazine and 50% UDMH, called Aerozine 50, in different stages. There is speculation that it is the fuel used in the ballistic missiles that North Korea has developed and tested in 2017.\n\nSafety: Hydrazine and its methyl derivatives are toxic but LD50 values have not been reported. It is a precursor to dimethylnitrosamine, which is carcinogenic.\nAccording to scientific data, usage of UDMH in rockets at Baikonur Cosmodrome has had adverse effects on the environment.\nOne such instance was the Nedelin catastrophe in 1960 when UDMH and dinitrogen tetroxide leaked from a rocket after an explosion and killed a number of bystanders through burn injuries and its toxicity.\n\nSee also: Aerozine 50\nC-Stoff\nDevil's venom\nUH 25\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Encyclopedia Astronautica\nCDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards\n\n\n pubchem:\n1,1-Dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) can cause cancer according to California Labor Code.\n1,1-dimethylhydrazine appears as a clear colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor.

Acute (short-term) inhalation exposure of humans to 1,1- dimethylhydrazine results in nose and throat irritation, mild conjunctivitis, nausea, and vomiting. It is also highly corrosive and irritating to the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Liver damage in humans may occur from chronic (long-term) exposure to 1,1-dimethylhydrazine. No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine in humans. Carcinogenic effects have been observed in animals exposed to 1,1-dimethylhydrazine by inhalation and orally, predominantly to the lung and liver. EPA has not classified 1,1-dimethylhydrazine for potential carcinogenicity. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified 1,1- dimethylhydrazine as a Group 2B, the chemical is possibly carcinogenic to humans.\n1,1-Dimethylhydrazine is a clear, colorless, flammable, hygroscopic liquid with a fishy smell that emits toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides when heated to decomposition, and turns yellow upon contact with air. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine is mainly used as a high-energy fuel in jets and rockets, but is also used in chemical synthesis, in photography and to control the growth of vegetation. This substance is also found in tobacco products. Exposure to 1,1-dimethylhydrazine results in irritation of skin, eyes and mucous membranes, and can affect liver and central nervous system. 1,1-Dimethylhydrazine is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.

        "text2": "Title: Trihexyphenidyl\nwikipedia: Trihexyphenidyl (THP,  benzhexol, trihex, marketed as Artane and others) is an antispasmodic drug used to treat stiffness, tremors, spasms, and poor muscle control. It is an agent of the antimuscarinic class and is often used  in management of Parkinson's disease. It was approved by the FDA for the treatment of Parkinson's in the US in 2003.\nIt is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\n\nMedical uses: Trihexyphenidyl is used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease in mono and combination therapy. It is active in postencephalitic, arteriosclerotic, and idiopathic forms. The drug is also commonly used to treat extrapyramidal side effects occurring during antipsychotic treatment. It reduces the frequency and duration of oculogyric crises as well as of dyskinetic movements and spastic contractions.  Trihexyphenidyl may improve psychotic depression and mental inertia frequently associated with Parkinson's disease and symptomatic problems caused by antipsychotic treatment. The drug cannot cure Parkinson's disease, but may provide substantial alleviation of symptoms. An estimated 50\u201375% of people with Parkinson's disease will react positively and experience a 20\u201330% symptomatic improvement. To increase therapeutic activity, trihexyphenidyl is often given concomitantly with levodopa or other antimuscarinic or antihistaminic (e.g. diphenhydramine) agents. Combination therapy with dopamine agonists such as cabergoline is also possible. This is often termed a 'multidimensional approach'. \nTrihexyphenidyl has also been prescribed for essential tremor and akathisia.\nIn pediatrics, it has been used for children with dystonia due to cerebral palsy, and to control drooling.\nIn organophosphate poisoning, trihexyphenidyl is a more effective antidote than atropine to counteract the cholinergic crisis, seizures, and neuropathology.\nEquivocal preliminary results from small studies exist for other dyskinesias, Huntington's chorea, Spasmodic torticollis.\n\nContraindications: Contraindications include according to the Therapeutic Goods Administration Australia from 2022:\n\nHypersensitivity to trihexyphenidyl\nNarrow angle glaucoma\nIleus (disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine)\nCaution: People with obstructive diseases of the urogenital tract, people with a known history of seizures and those with potentially dangerous tachycardia\nPeople under 18 years of age should not be treated due to a lack of clinical experience.\nPeople should allow a period to adjust to the dose when first starting trihexyphenidyl and when the dose has been increased or added to a regimen with other drugs because acute somnolence and accumulated fatigue can make it particularly dangerous to operate an automobile, heavy machinery etc.\n\nAdverse effects: Dose-dependent side effects are frequent, but typically lessen over time as the body adapts to the medication. All of the following symptoms considered, Artane has been shown to dramatically and consistently improve neurologic defects in people aged 16\u201386 over the course of five years. People who are older or who have psychiatric conditions may become confused or develop delirium. Side effects include but are not limited to:\n\nCentral nervous system: drowsiness, vertigo, headache, and dizziness are frequent. With high doses nervousness, agitation, anxiety, delirium, and confusion are noted. Trihexyphenidyl may be abused due to a short acting mood-elevating and euphoric effect. The normal sleep architecture may be altered (REM sleep depression). Trihexyphenidyl may lower the seizure-threshold.\nPeripheral side effects: dry mouth, impaired sweating, abdominal discomfort, nausea, and constipation are frequent. Tachycardia or heart palpitations (fast heart rate) may be noted. Allergic reactions are rare, but may occur. Many of these peripheral symptoms, especially considering an acute increase in anxiety with various physical complaints, as well as evidence of orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia are indicative of withdrawal, especially in people with psychiatric conditions \nEyes: trihexyphenidyl causes mydriasis with or without photophobia. It may precipitate narrow angle glaucoma or cause blurred vision.\nTolerance may develop during therapy which requires dose adjustments.\nStriated musculature and weight gain.\nTrihexyphenidyl is a pregnancy category C drug. It is advised to only use with caution if benefits outweigh risks.\n\nOverdose: Trihexyphenidyl and other antiparkinsonian drugs are known to be substances of abuse. This is true both in  abusers of other substances and in chronic schizophrenics, the latter being infrequent abusers of other drugs. \nOverdose mimics an atropine intoxication with dryness of mucous membranes, red face, bowel and bladder paralysis, and hyperthermia in high doses. Central nervous system consequences are agitation, confusion, and hallucinations. An untreated overdose may be fatal, particularly in children. Premortal signs are respiratory depression, arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. \nA specific antagonist is physostigmine, which combines a peripheral and a central action. \nCarbachol can be used to treat atonic bowel and bladder. It may be necessary to treat hyperthermia with cooling blankets.\nA case report of 24 hour long arrhythmia was treated with verapamil.\nExcessive myoclonus can be complicated by rhabdomyolysis; in one case risk  was increased due to concomitant use of risperidone.\n\nInteractions: Other anticholinergic drugs (e.g. spasmolytics, antihistamines, TCAs) : Side effects of trihexyphenidyl may be increased.\nQuinidine : Increased anticholinergic action (particular on AV conduction).\nAntipsychotics : Long term use of trihexyphenidyl  may mask or increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia.\nPethidine (meperidine) : Central effects and side effects of pethidine may be increased.\nMetoclopramide : Action of metoclopramide is decreased.\nAlcohol : Risk of serious intoxication.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Trihexyphenidyl is an anticholinergic. It is specifically an antimuscarinic and acts as a non-selective antagonist of all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. However, its antagonistic activity is much stronger at the muscarinic acetylcholine M1 and M4 receptors, and it can be described as selective for these receptors.\nThe exact mechanism of action in parkinsonian syndromes is not precisely understood, but it is known that trihexyphenidyl blocks efferent impulses in parasympathetically innervated structures like smooth muscles (spasmolytic activity), salivary glands, and eyes (mydriasis). In higher doses direct central inhibition of cerebral motor centers may contribute. In very high doses central toxicity as seen in atropine overdose is noted.\nIt possibly also binds to dopamine receptors.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Trihexyphenidyl is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The onset of action is within 1 hour after oral dosing. The peak activity is noted after 2 to 3 hours. The duration of action of one single dose is 6 to 12 hours in a dose dependent manner. It is excreted in the urine, probably as unchanged drug. More precise data in animals and humans have so far not been determined.\n\nHistory: Trihexyphenidyl has been clinically relevant in trials pertaining to Parkinson's disease since 1949.\nIn the US, the FDA approved Artane, or its generic form Trihexyphenidyl HCL, only on June 25, 2003 for the clinical use of all types of parkinsonism.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nRecreational use: The neurologist Oliver Sacks reported using the drug recreationally in the 1960s. He recalled taking \"a large dose\" knowing full well the drug was intended for people with Parkinson's. More recounts of Dr. Sacks' experiences \u2014 including experimentation with mescaline, psilocybin, LSD, and probably DMT \u2014 have been compared in his book Hallucinations.\nDuring the 1970s, trihexyphenidyl (trade name Parkan) was the most popular recreationally used prescription drug in Hungary.\nIn a 2008 news report, trihexyphenidyl was seen to be used for recreational purposes among Iraqi soldiers and police, among other prescription drugs. The report states that the drugs were taken to relieve combat stress reaction. Although that may be the case for some, others used Artane as a substitute or more intense version of LSD. This was especially prevalent in the 1960s, according to a report in \"The New Yorker\". Similarly to those in Iraqi forces, some of the appeal was that the individual may retain partial control while under the influence.\n\nChemistry: Trihexyphenidyl can be synthesized in two ways, one linear and one convergent synthesis.\nIn the first way, the initial 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is synthesized in turn by the aminomethylation of acetophenone using paraformaldehyde and piperidine in a Mannich reaction. In the second step the 2-(1-piperidino)propiophenone is reacted with cyclohexylmagnesium bromide in a Grignard reaction.\n\nStereochemistry: Trihexyphenidyl has a chiral center and two enantiomers. Medications are racemates.\n\nSee also: Biperiden (bicyclic ring)\nCycrimine (cyclopentanyl instead of cyclohexanyl)\nGamfexine\nProcyclidine\n\nReferences: \n This article incorporates public domain material from Toxnet:Trihexyphenidyl.

Its discovery was published in 1949 in a study looking for drugs with antispasmodic activity. Trihexyphenidyl is rarely used in the treatment of parkinsonism, and is not a first line treatment due to significant adverse effects. It has largely been replaced by drugs such as [levodopa].  Trihexyphenidyl was granted FDA approval on 13 May 1949.\nTrihexyphenidyl is an oral anticholinergic agent used predominantly in the symptomatic therapy of Parkinson disease and movement disorders. Trihexyphenidyl has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations during treatment, but has been implicated in rare cases of acute liver injury.\nTRIHEXYPHENIDYL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1949 and is indicated for parkinson disease and has 1 investigational indication.\nTrihexyphenidyl is only found in individuals that have used or taken this drug. It is one of the centrally acting muscarinic antagonists used for treatment of parkinsonian disorders and drug-induced extrapyramidal movement disorders and as an antispasmodic. Trihexyphenidyl is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It is able to discriminate between the M1 (cortical or neuronal) and the peripheral muscarinic subtypes (cardiac and glandular). Trihexyphenidyl partially blocks cholinergic activity in the CNS, which is responsible for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It is also thought to increase the availability of dopamine, a brain chemical that is critical in the initiation and smooth control of voluntary muscle movement.\nOne of the centrally acting MUSCARINIC ANTAGONISTS used for treatment of PARKINSONIAN DISORDERS and drug-induced extrapyramidal movement disorders and as an antispasmodic.\nSee also: Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride (has salt form).\nsafety: Acute Toxic\nsmiles: C1CCC(CC1)C(CCN2CCCCC2)(C3=CC=CC=C3)O\nforumla: C20H31NO\nchem_properties: Molecular Weight: 301.5 g/mol\nXLogP3: 4.5\nHydrogen Bond Donor Count: 1\nHydrogen Bond Acceptor Count: 2\nRotatable Bond Count: 5\nExact Mass: 301.240564612 Da\nMonoisotopic Mass: 301.240564612 Da\nTopological Polar Surface Area: 23.5\nHeavy Atom Count: 22\nFormal Charge: 0\nComplexity: 314\nIsotope Atom Count: 0\nDefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Atom Stereocenter Count: 1\nDefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nUndefined Bond Stereocenter Count: 0\nCovalently-Bonded Unit Count: 1\nCompound Is Canonicalized: Yes \n\n",

        "text2": "Title: Bronopol\nwikipedia: Bronopol (INN; chemical name 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol) is an organic compound that is used as an antimicrobial. It is a white solid although commercial samples appear yellow.\nThe first reported synthesis of bronopol was in 1897.\nBromopol was invented by The Boots Company PLC in the early 1960s and first applications were as a preservative for pharmaceuticals. Due to its low mammalian toxicity at in-use levels and high activity against bacteria, especially Gram-negative species, bronopol became popular as a preservative in many consumer products such as shampoos and cosmetics. It was subsequently adopted as an antimicrobial in other industrial environments such as paper mills, oil exploration, and production facilities, as well as cooling water disinfection plants.\n\nProduction: Bronopol is produced by the bromination of di(hydroxymethyl)nitromethane, which is derived from nitromethane by a nitroaldol reaction.  World production increased from the tens of tonnes in the late 1970s to current estimates in excess of 5,000 tonnes. Production today is the business of low cost producers, mainly in China.\n\nApplications: Bronopol is used in consumer products as an effective preservative agent, as well as a wide variety of industrial applications (almost any industrial water system is a potential environment for bacterial growth, leading to slime and corrosion problems - in many of these systems bronopol can be a highly effective treatment).\nThe use of bronopol in personal care products (cosmetics, toiletries) has declined since the late 1980s due to the potential formation of nitrosamines. While bronopol is not in itself a nitrosating agent, under conditions where it decomposes (alkaline solution and/or elevated temperatures) it can liberate nitrite and low levels of formaldehyde and these decomposition products can react with any contaminant secondary amines or amides in a personal care formulation to produce significant levels of nitrosamines (due to the toxicity of these substances, the term 'significant' means levels as low as tens of parts per billion).\nManufacturers of personal care products are therefore instructed by regulatory authorities to avoid the formation of nitrosamines which might mean removing amines or amides from the formulation, removing bronopol from a formulation, or using nitrosamine inhibitors.\nBronopol has been restricted for use in cosmetics in Canada.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties: \n\nAppearance: Bronopol is supplied as crystals or crystalline powder, which may vary from white to pale yellow in colour depending on the grade. The yellow coloration is due to chelation of iron during the manufacturing process.\n\nMelting point: As a pure material, bronopol has a melting point of about 130 \u00b0C. However, due to its polymorphic characteristics, bronopol undergoes a lattice rearrangement at 100 to 105 \u00b0C and this can often be wrongly interpreted as the melting point.\nAt temperatures above 140 \u00b0C, bronopol decomposes exothermically releasing hydrogen bromide and oxides of nitrogen.\n\nSolubility: Bronopol is readily soluble in water; the dissolution process is endothermic. Solutions containing up to 28% w/v are possible at ambient temperature.\nBronopol is poorly soluble in non-polar solvents but shows a high affinity for polar organic solvents.\n\nPartition coefficient: Study of the solubility data shows that bronopol has a high affinity for polar rather than non-polar environments. In two-phase systems, bronopol partitions preferentially into the polar (usually aqueous) phase.\n\nStability in aqueous solution: In aqueous solutions, bronopol is most stable when the pH of the system is on the acid side of neutral. Temperature also has a significant effect on stability in alkaline systems.\n\nDegradation: Under extreme alkaline conditions, bronopol decomposes in aqueous solution and very low levels of formaldehyde are produced. Liberated formaldehyde is not responsible for the biological activity associated with bronopol. Other decomposition products detected after bronopol breakdown are bromide ion, nitrite ion, bromonitroethanol and 2-hydroxymethyl-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol.\n\nAllergy: In 2005\u20132006, it was the 15th-most-prevalent allergen in patch tests (3.4%) of people with suspected allergic contact dermatitis. It is used as a substitute for formaldehyde, a disinfectant and preservative, in solvents. It is prevalent in skin and personal care products and topical medications.\n\nSee also: Bronidox\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Material Safety Data Sheet for Bronopol\n\n\n pubchem:\n2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol appears as white crystals. Ignite easily and burn readily. May detonate under strong shock. Decomposes when heated, evolving toxic gases. Toxic by skin absorption, inhalation or ingestion.\nBronopol is a nitro compound.\nBronopol, or 2-Bromo-2-nitro-1,3-propanediol, is an organic compound with wide-spectrum antimicrobial properties. First synthesized in 1897, bronopol was primarily used as a preservative for pharmaceuticals and was registered in the United States in 1984 for use in industrial bactericides, slimicides and preservatives. Bronopol is used as a microbicide or microbiostat in various commercial and industrial applications, including oil field systems, air washer systems, air conditioning or humidifying systems, cooling water systems, papermills, absorbent clays, metal working fluids, printing inks, paints, adhesives and consumer products. Compared to other aliphatic halogen-nitro compounds, bronopol is more stable to hydrolysis in aqueous media under normal conditions. The inhibitory activity against various bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was demonstrated in vitro. The agent is largely available commercially as an antibacterial for a variety of industrial purposes while it is predominantly available for purchase as a pet animal litter antibacterial at the domestic consumer level. Nevertheless, ongoing contemporary re-evaluations of bronopol use in large markets such as Canada now place various compositional and product restrictions on the use of the agent in cosmetic products and in other products where it may not primarily be used in the role of a non-medicinal preservative antimicrobial.\nBronopol is a Standardized Chemical Allergen. The physiologic effect of bronopol is by means of Increased Histamine Release, and Cell-mediated Immunity.\nBRONOPOL is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of II.\nBronopol is a chemical compound of bromine and an antimicrobial substance. It is used as a preservative in pharmaceuticals, as well as numerous consumer products such as shampoos and cosmetics. It is also used as an antimicrobial in many industrial environments such as paper mills, oil exploration and production facilities, as well as cooling water disinfection plants. Its use is declining due to its recognized potential to decompose into carcinogenic nitrosamines. It is also a formaldehyde releaser. (L643, L1893)\nSee also: Bronopol; glycerin (component of) ...

It is a colourless, volatile and poisonous gas, condensing at 23.5 \u00b0C. It is the predominant tautomer and an isomer of cyanic acid (aka. cyanol) (H\u2212O\u2212C\u2261N), and the monomer of cyanuric acid.\nThe derived anion of isocyanic acid is the same as the derived anion of cyanic acid, and that anion is [N=C=O]\u2212, which is called cyanate. The related functional group \u2212N=C=O is isocyanate; it is distinct from cyanate (\u2212O\u2212C\u2261N), fulminate (\u2212O\u2212N+\u2261C\u2212), and nitrile oxide (\u2212C\u2261N+\u2212O\u2212).\nIsocyanic acid was discovered in 1830 by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich W\u00f6hler.\nIsocyanic acid is the simplest stable chemical compound that contains carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, the four most commonly found elements in organic chemistry and biology. It is the only fairly stable one of the four linear isomers with molecular formula HOCN that have been synthesized, the others being cyanic acid (cyanol, H\u2212O\u2212C\u2261N) and the elusive fulminic acid (H\u2212C\u2261N+\u2212O\u2212) and isofulminic acid H\u2212O\u2212N+\u2261C\u2212.\n\nStructure: \n\nIsocyanic acid (HNCO): Although the electronic structure according to valence bond theory can be written as H\u2212N=C=O, the vibrational spectrum has a band at 2268.8 cm\u22121 in the gas phase, which some say indicates a carbon\u2013nitrogen triple bond. If so, then the canonical form H\u2212N+\u2261C\u2212O\u2212 is the major resonance structure.\nHowever, classic vibrational analysis would indicate that the 2268.8 cm\u22121 is the asymmetric N=C=O stretch, as per Colthup et al., as well as the NIST Chemistry WebBook, which also reports the corresponding symmetric N=C=O stretch (weak in infrared, but strong in Raman) to be 1327 cm\u22121.  Based on these classic assignments, there is no need to invoke a full charged state for the N and O atoms, to explain the vibrational spectral data.\n\nCyanic acid (HOCN): The tautomer, known as cyanic acid, HOCN, in which the oxygen atom is protonated exists in equilibrium with isocyanic acid to the extent of about 3%. The vibrational spectrum is indicative of the presence of a triple bond between the nitrogen and carbon atoms.\n\nProperties: In aqueous solution it is a weak acid, having a pKa of 3.7:\n\nHNCO  \u21cc  H+ + NCO\u2212\nIsocyanic acid hydrolyses to carbon dioxide and ammonia:\n\nHNCO + H2O  \u2192  CO2 + NH3\nDilute solutions of isocyanic acid are stable in inert solvents, e.g. ether and chlorinated hydrocarbons.\nAt high concentrations, isocyanic acid oligomerizes to give the trimer cyanuric acid and cyamelide, a polymer.  These species usually are easily separated from liquid- or gas-phase reaction products.\nIsocyanic acid reacts with amines to give ureas (carbamides):\n\nHNCO + RNH2  \u2192  RNHC(O)NH2\nThis reaction is called carbamylation.  Excess isocyanic acid can react with the ureas to give allophanates.    \nHNCO adds across electron-rich double bonds, such as vinylethers, to give the corresponding isocyanates.\nIsocyanic acid, HNCO, is a Lewis acid whose free energy, enthalpy and entropy changes for its 1:1 association with a number of bases in carbon tetrachloride solution at 25 \u00b0C have been reported. The acceptor properties of HNCO are compared with other Lewis acid in the ECW model.\nLow-temperature photolysis of solids containing HNCO creates the tautomer cyanic acid H\u2212O\u2212C\u2261N, also called hydrogen cyanate. Pure cyanic acid has not been isolated, and isocyanic acid is the predominant form in all solvents. Sometimes information presented for cyanic acid in reference books is actually for isocyanic acid.\n\nPreparation: Isocyanic acid can be made by protonation of the cyanate anion, such as from salts like potassium cyanate, by either gaseous hydrogen chloride or acids such as oxalic acid.\n\nH+ + NCO\u2212  \u2192  HNCO\nHNCO also can be made by the high-temperature thermal decomposition of the trimer cyanuric acid:\n\nC3H3N3O3  \u2192  3 HNCO\nIn all cases the resulting acid must be kept very cold or in gaseous form, as concentrated isocyanic acid polymerizes rapidly above \u221220 \u00b0C.    \nIn the reverse of the famous synthesis of urea by Friedrich W\u00f6hler,\n\nCO(NH2)2  \u2192  HNCO + NH3\nisocyanic acid is produced and rapidly trimerizes to cyanuric acid.\n\nOccurrence: Isocyanic acid has been detected in many kinds of interstellar environments.\nIsocyanic acid is also present in various forms of smoke, including smog and cigarette smoke. It was detected using mass spectrometry, and easily dissolves in water, posing a health risk to the lungs.\n\nSee also: Cyanate\nThiocyanic acid\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: Walter, Wolfgang (1997).

        "text2": "Title: Carbamate\nwikipedia: In organic chemistry, a carbamate is a category of organic compounds with the general formula R2NC(O)OR and structure >N\u2212C(=O)\u2212O\u2212, which are formally derived from carbamic acid (NH2COOH).  The term includes organic compounds (e.g., the ester ethyl carbamate), formally obtained by replacing one or more of the hydrogen atoms by other organic functional groups; as well as salts with the carbamate anion H2NCOO\u2212 (e.g. ammonium carbamate).\nPolymers whose repeat units are joined by carbamate like groups \u2212NH\u2212C(=O)\u2212O\u2212 are an important family of plastics, the polyurethanes. See \u00a7 Etymology for clarification.\n\nProperties: While carbamic acids are unstable, many carbamate esters and salts are stable and well known.\n\nEquilibrium with carbonate and bicarbonate: In water solutions, the carbamate anion slowly equilibrates with the ammonium NH+4 cation and the carbonate CO2\u22123 or bicarbonate HCO\u22123 anions:\n\nH2NCO\u22122  +  2 H2O  \u21cc  NH+4  +  HCO\u22123 +  OH\u2212\nH2NCO\u22122  +   H2O  \u21cc   NH+4  +  CO2\u22123\nCalcium carbamate is soluble in water, whereas calcium carbonate is not.  Adding a calcium salt to an ammonium carbamate/carbonate solution will precipitate some calcium carbonate immediately, and then slowly precipitate more as the carbamate hydrolyzes.\n\nSynthesis: \n\nCarbamate salts: The salt ammonium carbamate is generated by treatment of ammonia with carbon dioxide:\n\n2 NH3  +  CO2   \u2192    NH4[H2NCO2]\n\nCarbamate esters: Carbamate esters also arise via alcoholysis of carbamoyl chlorides:\n\nR2NC(O)Cl + R'OH \u2192 R2NCO2R' + HCl\nAlternatively, carbamates can be formed from chloroformates and amines:\n\nR'OC(O)Cl + R2NH \u2192 R2NCO2R' + HCl\nCarbamates may be formed from the Curtius rearrangement, where isocyanates formed are reacted with an alcohol.\n\nRCON3 \u2192 RNCO + N2\nRNCO + R\u2032OH \u2192 RNHCO2R\u2032\n\nNatural occurrence: Within nature carbon dioxide can bind with neutral amine groups to form a carbamate, this post-translational modification is known as carbamylation. This modification is known to occur on several important proteins; see examples below.\n\nHemoglobin: The N-terminal amino groups of valine residues in the \u03b1- and \u03b2-chains of deoxyhemoglobin exist as carbamates. They help to stabilise the protein when it becomes deoxyhemoglobin, and increases the likelihood of the release of remaining oxygen molecules bound to the protein. This stabilizing effect should not be confused with the Bohr effect (an indirect effect caused by carbon dioxide).\n\nUrease and phosphotriesterase: The \u03b5-amino groups of the lysine residues in urease and phosphotriesterase also feature carbamate. The carbamate derived from aminoimidazole is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of inosine. Carbamoyl phosphate is generated from carboxyphosphate\nrather than CO2.\n\nCO2 capture by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase: Perhaps the most prevalent carbamate is the one involved in the capture of CO2 by plants.  This process is necessary for their growth. The enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) fixes a molecule of carbon dioxide as phosphoglycerate in the Calvin cycle. At the active site of the enzyme, a Mg2+ ion is bound to glutamate and aspartate residues as well as a lysine carbamate. The carbamate is formed when an uncharged lysine side chain near the ion reacts with a carbon dioxide molecule from the air (not the substrate carbon dioxide molecule), which then renders it charged, and, therefore, able to bind the Mg2+ ion.\n\nApplications: \n\nSynthesis of urea: Although not usually isolated as such, the salt ammonium carbamate is produced on a large scale as an intermediate in the production of the commodity chemical urea from ammonia and carbon dioxide.\n\nPolyurethane plastics: Polyurethanes contain multiple carbamate groups as part of their structure. The \"urethane\" in the name \"polyurethane\" refers to these carbamate groups; the term \"urethane links\" describe how carbamates polymerize.[Requires Citation] In contrast, the substance commonly called \"urethane\", ethyl carbamate, is neither a component of polyurethanes, nor is it used in their manufacture.[Requires Citation] Urethanes are usually formed by reaction of an alcohol with an isocyanate.[Requires Citation] Commonly, urethanes made by a non-isocyanate route are called carbamates.[Requires Citation]\nPolyurethane polymers have a wide range of properties and are commercially available as foams, elastomers, and solids. Typically, polyurethane polymers are made by combining diisocyanates, e.g. toluene diisocyanate, and diols, where the carbamate groups are formed by reaction of the alcohols with the isocyanates:\n\nRN=C=O + R\u2032OH \u2192 RNHC(O)OR\u2032\n\nCarbamate insecticides: The so-called carbamate insecticides feature the carbamate ester functional group. Included in this group are aldicarb (Temik), carbofuran (Furadan), carbaryl (Sevin), ethienocarb, fenobucarb, oxamyl, and methomyl. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE inhibition) (IRAC mode of action 1a). The organophosphate pesticides also inhibit this enzyme, although irreversibly, and cause a more severe form of cholinergic poisoning (the similar IRAC MoA 1b).\nFenoxycarb has a carbamate group but acts as a juvenile hormone mimic, rather than inactivating acetylcholinesterase.\nThe insect repellent icaridin is a substituted carbamate.\nBesides their common use as arthropodocides/insecticides, they are also nematicidal. One such is Oxamyl.\nSales have declined dramatically over recent decades.\n\nResistance: Among mutations in esterases, carbamate resistance most commonly involves acetylcholinesterase (AChE) desensitization, while organophosphate resistance most commonly is carboxylesterase metabolization.\n\nCarbamate nerve agents: While the carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are commonly referred to as \"carbamate insecticides\" due to their generally high selectivity for insect acetylcholinesterase enzymes over the mammalian versions, the most potent compounds such as aldicarb and carbofuran are still capable of inhibiting mammalian acetylcholinesterase enzymes at low enough concentrations that they pose a significant risk of poisoning to humans, especially when used in large amounts for agricultural applications. Other carbamate based acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are known with even higher toxicity to humans, and some such as T-1123 and EA-3990 were investigated for potential military use as nerve agents. However, since all compounds of this type have a quaternary ammonium group with a permanent positive charge, they have poor blood\u2013brain barrier penetration, and also are only stable as crystalline salts or aqueous solutions, and so were not considered to have suitable properties for weaponisation.\n\nPreservatives and cosmetics: Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate is a wood and paint preservative and used in cosmetics.\n\nChemical research: Some of the most common amine protecting groups, such as Boc, Fmoc, benzyl chloroformate and trichloroethyl chloroformate are carbamates.\n\nMedicine: \n\nEthyl carbamate: Urethane (ethyl carbamate) was once produced commercially in the United States as a chemotherapy agent and for other medicinal purposes. It was found to be toxic and largely ineffective. It is occasionally used in veterinary medicine in combination with other drugs to produce anesthesia.\n\nCarbamate drugs: In addition, some carbamates are used in human pharmacotherapy, for example, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors neostigmine and rivastigmine, whose chemical structure is based on the natural alkaloid physostigmine. Other examples are meprobamate and its derivatives like carisoprodol, felbamate, mebutamate, phenprobamate, and tybamate, a class of anxiolytic and muscle relaxant drugs widely used in the 1960s before the rise of benzodiazepines, and still used nowadays in some cases. Carbachol is primarily used for various ophthalmic purposes.\nThe protease inhibitor darunavir for HIV treatment also contains a carbamate functional group.\nEphedroxane, an aminorex analogue used as a stimulant, also falls into the carbamate category.\n\nToxicity: Besides inhibiting human acetylcholinesterase (although to a lesser degree than the insect enzyme), carbamate insecticides also target human melatonin receptors. The human health effects of carbamates are well documented in the list of known endocrine disruptor compounds. Clinical effects of carbamate exposure can vary from slightly toxic to highly toxic depending on a variety of factors including such as dose and route of exposure with ingestion and inhalation resulting in the most rapid clinical effects. These clinical manifestations of carbamate intoxication are muscarinic signs, nicotinic signs, and in rare cases central nervous system signs.\n\nSulfur analogues: There are two oxygen atoms in a carbamate (1), ROC(=O)NR2, and either or both of them can be conceptually replaced by sulfur. Analogues of carbamates with only one of the oxygens replaced by sulfur are called thiocarbamates (2 and 3). Carbamates with both oxygens replaced by sulfur are called dithiocarbamates (4), RSC(=S)NR2.\nThere are two different structurally isomeric types of thiocarbamate:\n\nO-thiocarbamates (2), ROC(=S)NR2, where the carbonyl group (C=O) is replaced with a thiocarbonyl group (C=S)\nS-thiocarbamates (3), RSC(=O)NR2, where the R\u2013O\u2013 group is replaced with an R\u2013S\u2013 group\nO-thiocarbamates can isomerise to S-thiocarbamates, for example in the Newman\u2013Kwart rearrangement.\n\nEtymology: The etymology of the words \"urethane\" and \"carbamate\" are highly similar but not the same. The word \"urethane\" was first coined in 1833 by French chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas. Dumas states \"Urethane. The new ether, brought into contact with liquid and concentrated ammonia, exerts on this substance a reaction so strong that the mixture boils, and sometimes even produces a sort of explosion. If the ammonia is in excess, all the ether disappears. It forms ammonium hydrochlorate and a new substance endowed with interesting properties.\" Dumas appears to be naming this compound urethane. However, later Dumas states \"While waiting for opinion to settle on the nature of this body, I propose to designate by the names of urethane and oxamethane the two materials which I have just studied, and which I regard as types of a new family, among nitrogenous substances. These names which, in my eyes, do not prejudge anything in the question of alcohol and ethers, will at least have the advantage of satisfying chemists who still refuse to accept our theory.\" The word urethane is derived from the words \"urea\" and \"ether\" with the suffix \"-ane\" as a generic chemical suffix, making it specific for the R2NC(=O)OR' (R' not = H) bonding structure.\nThe use of the word \"carbamate\" appears to come later only being traced back to at least 1849, in a description of Dumas's work by Henry Medlock. Medlock states \"It is well known that the action of ammonia on chloro-carbonate (phosgene) of ethyl gives rise to the formation of the substance which Dumas, the discoverer, called urethane, and which we are now in the habit of considering as the ether of carbamic acid.\" This suggests that instead of continuing with the urethane family naming convention Dumas coined, they altered the naming convention to ethyl ether of carbamic acid. Carbamate is derived from the words \"carbamide\", otherwise known as urea, and \"-ate\" a suffix which indicates the salt or ester of an acid.\nBoth words have roots deriving from urea. Carbamate is less-specific because the -ate suffix is ambiguous for either the salt or ester of a carbamic acid. However, the -ate suffix is also more specific because it suggests carbamates must be derived from the acid of carbamate, or carbamic acids. Although, a urethane has the same chemical structure as a carbamate ester moiety, a urethane not derived from a carbamic acid is not a carbamate ester. In other words, any synthesis of the R2NC(=O)OR' (R' not = H) moiety that does not derive from carbamic acids is not a carbamate ester but instead a urethane. Furthermore, carbamate esters are urethanes but not all urethanes are carbamate esters. This further suggests that polyurethanes are not simply polycarbamate-esters because polyurethanes are not typically synthesized using carbamic acids.\nIUPAC states  \"The esters are often called urethanes or urethans, a usage that is strictly correct only for the ethyl esters.\" But also states, \"An alternative term for the compounds R2NC(=O)OR' (R' not = H), esters of carbamic acids, R,NC(=O)OH, in strict use limited to the ethyl esters, but widely used in the general sense\". IUPAC provides these statements without citation.\n\nSee also: Methyl carbamate\nEthyl carbamate\nPolyurethane\nCholinesterase inhibitor\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nCarbamate is an amino-acid anion.

        "answer": "Carbamate esters are a category of organic compounds with the general formula R2NCO2R'. They can be synthesized via alcoholysis of carbamoyl chlorides: R2NC(O)Cl + R'OH \u2192 R2NCO2R' + HCl. Alternatively, carbamates can be formed from chloroformates and amines: R'OC(O)Cl + R2NH \u2192 R2NCO2R' + HCl.

        "text1": "Title: 1,1,1-Trichloroethane\nwikipedia: The organic compound 1,1,1-trichloroethane, also known as methyl chloroform and chlorothene, is a chloroalkane with the chemical formula CH3CCl3. It is an isomer of 1,1,2-trichloroethane. A colourless and sweet-smelling liquid, it was once produced industrially in large quantities for use as a solvent. It is regulated by the Montreal Protocol as an ozone-depleting substance and as such use has declined since 1996. Trichloroethane should not be confused with the similar-sounding trichloroethene which is also commonly used as a solvent.\n\nProduction: 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was first reported by Henri Victor Regnault in 1840. Industrially, it is usually produced in a two-step process from vinyl chloride. In the first step, vinyl chloride reacts with hydrogen chloride at 20-50 \u00b0C to produce 1,1-dichloroethane:\n\nCH2=CHCl + HCl \u2192 CH3CHCl2\nThis reaction is catalyzed by a variety of Lewis acids, mainly aluminium chloride, iron(III) chloride, or zinc chloride. The 1,1-dichloroethane is then converted to 1,1,1-trichloroethane by reaction with chlorine under ultraviolet irradiation:\n\nCH3CHCl2 + Cl2 \u2192 CH3CCl3 + HCl\nThis reaction proceeds at 80-90% yield, and the hydrogen chloride byproduct can be recycled to the first step in the process. The major side-product is the related compound 1,1,2-trichloroethane, from which the 1,1,1-trichloroethane can be separated by distillation.\nA somewhat smaller amount of 1,1,1-trichloroethane is produced from the reaction of 1,1-dichloroethene and hydrogen chloride in the presence of an iron(III) chloride catalyst:\n\nCH2=CCl2 + HCl \u2192 CH3CCl3\n1,1,1-Trichloroethane is sold with stabilizers because it is unstable with respect to dehydrochlorination and attacks some metals. Stabilizers comprise up to 8% of the formulation, including acid scavengers (epoxides, amines) and complexants.\n\nUses: 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is an excellent solvent for many organic compounds and also one of the least toxic of the chlorinated hydrocarbons. It is generally considered non-polar, but owing to the good polarizability of the chlorine atoms, it is a superior solvent for organic compounds that do not dissolve well in hydrocarbons such as hexane. Prior to the Montreal Protocol, it was widely used for cleaning metal parts and circuit boards, as a photoresist solvent in the electronics industry, as an aerosol propellant, as a cutting fluid additive, and as a solvent for inks, paints, adhesives, and other coatings. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was used to dry-clean leather and suede. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is also used as an insecticidal fumigant.\nIt was also the standard cleaner for photographic film (movie/slide/negatives, etc.). Other commonly available solvents damage emulsion and base (acetone will severely damage triacetate base on most films), and thus are not suitable for this application. The standard replacement, Forane 141 is much less effective, and tends to leave a residue. 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was used as a thinner in correction fluid products such as liquid paper. Many of its applications previously used carbon tetrachloride (which was banned in US consumer products in 1970). In turn, 1,1,1-trichloroethane itself is now being replaced by other solvents in the laboratory.\n\nAnaesthetic research: 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was one of the volatile organochlorides that have been tried as alternatives to chloroform in anaesthesia.\nIn the 1880s, it was found to be a safe and strong substitute for chloroform but its production was too expensive and difficult for the era.\nIn 1880, 1,1,1-Trichloroethane was suggested as an anaesthetic. It was first referred to as \"methyl-chloroform\" in the same year. At the time, the narcotic effects of chloral hydrate were owed to a hypothetical metabolic pathway to chloroform in \"alkaline blood\". Trichloroethane was studied for its structural similarity to chloral and potential anaesthetic effects. However, trichloroethane did not exhibit any conversion to chloroform in laboratory experiments. The 1,1,2-trichloroethane isomer, which lacked a trichloromethyl group, exhibited anaesthetic effects even stronger than the 1,1,1 isomer.\n\nSafety: Although not as toxic as many similar compounds, inhaled or ingested 1,1,1-trichloroethane does act as a central nervous system depressant and can cause effects similar to those of ethanol intoxication, including dizziness, confusion, and, in sufficiently high concentrations, unconsciousness and death. Fatal poisonings and illnesses linked to intentional inhalation of trichloroethane have been reported. \nProlonged skin contact with the liquid can result in the removal of fats from the skin, resulting in skin irritation.\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer places 1,1,1-trichloroethane in Group 2A as a probable carcinogen.\n\nAtmospheric concentration: 1,1,1-Trichloroethane is a fairly potent greenhouse gas with a 100-year global warming potential of 169 relative to carbon dioxide. This is nonetheless less than a tenth that of carbon tetrachloride \u2014 which it replaced as a solvent \u2014 due to its relatively short atmospheric lifetime of about 5 years.\nThe Montreal Protocol targeted 1,1,1-trichloroethane as a compound responsible for ozone depletion and banned its use beginning in 1996. Since then, its manufacture and use have been phased out throughout most of the world, and its atmospheric concentration has declined substantially.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: Doherty, R.E.

The mesityl group (Mes) is a substituent with the formula C6H2Me3 and is found in various other compounds.\n\nPreparation: Mesitylene is prepared by transalkylation of xylene over solid acid catalyst:\n\n2 C6H4(CH3)2 \u21cc C6H3(CH3)3 + C6H5CH3\nC6H4(CH3)2 + CH3OH \u2192 C6H3(CH3)3 + H2O\nAlthough impractical, it could be prepared by trimerization of propyne, also requiring an acid catalyst, yields a mixture of 1,3,5- and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzenes.\nTrimerization of acetone via aldol condensation, which is catalyzed and dehydrated by sulfuric acid is another method of synthesizing mesitylene.\n\nReactions: Oxidation of mesitylene with nitric acid yields trimesic acid, C6H3(COOH)3. Using manganese dioxide, a milder oxidising agent, 3,5-dimethylbenzaldehyde is formed.  Mesitylene is oxidised by trifluoroperacetic acid to produce mesitol (2,4,6-trimethylphenol). Bromination occurs readily, giving mesityl bromide:\n\n(CH3)3C6H3 + Br2 \u2192 (CH3)3C6H2Br + HBr\nMesitylene is a ligand in organometallic chemistry, one example being the organomolybdenum complex [(\u03b76-C6H3Me3)Mo(CO)3] which can be prepared from molybdenum hexacarbonyl.\n\nApplications: Mesitylene is mainly used as a precursor to 2,4,6-trimethylaniline, a precursor to colorants. This derivative is prepared by selective mononitration of mesitylene, avoiding oxidation of the methyl groups.\n\nNiche uses: Mesitylene is used in the laboratory as a specialty solvent. In the electronics industry, mesitylene has been used as a developer for photopatternable silicones due to its solvent properties.\nThe three aromatic hydrogen atoms of mesitylene are in identical chemical shift environments. Therefore, they only give a single peak near 6.8 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum; the same is also true for the nine methyl protons, which give a singlet near 2.3 ppm. For this reason, mesitylene is sometimes used as an internal standard in NMR samples that contain aromatic protons.\nUvitic acid is obtained by oxidizing mesitylene or by condensing pyruvic acid with baryta water.\nThe Gattermann reaction can be simplified by replacing the HCN/AlCl3 combination with zinc cyanide (Zn(CN)2). Although it is highly toxic, Zn(CN)2 is a solid, making it safer to work with than gaseous hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The Zn(CN)2 reacts with the HCl to form the key HCN reactant and ZnCl2 that serves as the Lewis-acid catalyst in-situ. An example of the Zn(CN)2 method is the synthesis of mesitaldehyde from mesitylene.\n\nHistory: Mesitylene was first prepared in 1837 by Robert Kane, an Irish chemist, by heating acetone with concentrated sulfuric acid. He named his new substance \"mesitylene\" because the German chemist Carl Reichenbach had named acetone \"mesit\" (from the Greek \u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, the mediator), and Kane believed that his reaction had dehydrated mesit, converting it to an alkene, \"mesitylene\". However, Kane's determination of the chemical composition (\"empirical formula\") of mesitylene was incorrect. The correct empirical formula was provided by August W. von Hofmann in 1849. In 1866 Adolf von Baeyer gave a correct mesitylene's empirical formula; however, with a wrong structure of tetracyclo[3.1.1.11,3.13,5]nonane. A conclusive proof that mesitylene was trimethylbenzene was provided by Albert Ladenburg in 1874; however, assuming wrong benzene structure of prismane.\n\n\tHistorical mesitylene structures\n\nMesityl group: The group (CH3)3C6H2- is called mesityl (organic group symbol: Mes). Mesityl derivatives, e.g. tetramesityldiiron, are typically prepared from the Grignard reagent (CH3)3C6H2MgBr.  Due to its large steric demand, the mesityl group is used as a large blocking group in asymmetric catalysis (to enhance diastereo- or enantioselectivity) and organometallic chemistry (to stabilize low oxidation state or low coordination number metal centers).  Larger analogues with even greater steric demand, for example 2,6-diisopropylphenyl (Dipp) and the analogously named Tripp ((iPr)3C6H2, Is) and supermesityl ((tBu)3C6H2, Mes*) groups, may be even more effective toward achieving these goals.\n\nSafety and the environment: Mesitylene is also a major urban volatile organic compound (VOC) which results from combustion. It plays a significant role in aerosol and tropospheric ozone formation as well as other reactions in atmospheric chemistry.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\n1,3,5-trimethylbenzene appears as a colorless liquid with a peculiar odor.

        "text1": "Title: Tryptophan\nwikipedia: Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an \u03b1-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an  \u03b1-amino group, an \u03b1-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG.\nLike other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (\u2013NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( \u2013COO\u2212; pKa = 2.38).\nHumans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid.\nTryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter.\n\nFunction: Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in \"anchoring\" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds:\n\nSerotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase.\nMelatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes.\nKynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder.\nNiacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids.\nAuxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan.\nThe disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression.\nIn bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan.  So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels.\n\nRecommended dietary allowance: In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over.\n\nDietary sources: Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry.\n\nMedical use: \n\nDepression: Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not.\nIn 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that \"the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive\" and note that \"because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present\". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence.\n\nInsomnia: The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness.\n\nSide effects: Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).\n\nInteractions: Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known.\n\nIsolation: The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4\u20138 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein.\n\nBiosynthesis and industrial production: As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine.\n\nThe industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nShowa Denko contamination scandal: There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit.\nSubsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer.\nThe FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005.\nThe fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for \"close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products\". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech.\n\nTurkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis: A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat\u2014as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas\u2014results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood\u2013brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin\u2014which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm\u2014by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that \"feast-induced drowsiness\"\u2014or postprandial somnolence\u2014may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep.\n\nResearch: \n\nYeast amino acid metabolism: In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol.\n\nSerotonin precursor: Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness.\n\nPsychedelic effects: Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics.\n\nFluorescence: Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue.  Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues.\n\nSee also: 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)\n\u03b1-Methyltryptophan\nAcree\u2013Rosenheim reaction\nAdamkiewicz reaction\nAttenuator (genetics)\nN,N-Dimethyltryptamine\nHopkins\u2013Cole reaction\nSerotonin\nTryptamine\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: \n\n== External links ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nL-tryptophan is a white powder with a flat taste.

Tryptophan is converted to 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP), converted in turn to serotonin, a neurotransmitter essential in regulating appetite, sleep, mood, and pain. Tryptophan is a natural sedative and present in dairy products, meats, brown rice, fish, and soybeans. (NCI04)\nTRYPTOPHAN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) and is indicated for unipolar depression and has 7 investigational indications. It was withdrawn in at least one region.\nTryptophan is an essential amino acid which is the precursor of serotonin. Serotonin is a brain neurotransmitter, platelet clotting factor and neurohormone found in organs throughout the body. Metabolism of tryptophan to serotonin requires nutrients such as vitamin B6, niacin and glutathione. Niacin is an important metabolite of tryptophan. High corn or other tryptophan-deficient diets can cause pellagra, which is a niacin-tryptophan deficiency disease with symptoms of dermatitis, diarrhea and dementia. Inborn errors of tryptophan metabolism exist where a tumor (carcinoid) makes excess serotonin. Hartnup's disease is a disease where tryptophan and other amino acids are not absorbed properly. Tryptophan supplements may be useful in each condition, in carcinoid replacing the over-metabolized nutrient and in Hartnup's supplementing a malabsorbed nutrient. Some disorders of excess tryptophan in the blood may contribute to mental retardation. Assessment of tryptophan deficiency is done through studying excretion of tryptophan metabolites in the urine or blood. Blood may be the most sensitive test because the amino acid tryptophan is transported in a unique way. Increased urination of tryptophan fragments correlates with increased tryptophan degradation, which occurs with oral contraception, depression, mental retardation, hypertension and anxiety states. The requirement for tryptophan and protein decreases with age. Adults' minimum daily requirement is 3 mg/kg/day or about 200 mg a day. This may be an underestimation, for there are 400 mg of tryptophan in just a cup of wheat germ. A cup of low fat cottage cheese contains 300 mg of tryptophan and chicken and turkey contain up to 600 mg per pound.\nAn essential amino acid that is necessary for normal growth in infants and for NITROGEN balance in adults.

Similar to melatonin, 6-OHM is a full agonist of the MT1 and MT2 receptors. It is also an antioxidant and neuroprotective, and is even more potent in this regard relative to melatonin.\n\nRole in metabolism: The determination of 6-OHM in human urine has been used to track the metabolism and excretion of melatonin using LC-MS/MS, providing quantifiable insights into circadian rhythm regulation and its oxidative role as a biomarker. 6-OHM is one of four of the primary metabolic products of melatonin in the liver and is also a byproduct of its breakdown due to exposure to light. It is known to be very effective in protecting cells from oxidative damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Based on comparisons with other melatonin-related compounds, it is suggested that the protective effects of 6-OHM in mitigating oxidative stress are primarily attributed to their ability to scavenge free radicals.\n\nSee also: N-Acetylserotonin (normelatonin)\n5-Methoxytryptamine\nMelatonin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\n6-hydroxymelatonin is a member of the class of tryptamines that is melatonin with a hydroxy group substituent at position 6.

        "text1": "Title: Ethylenediamine\nwikipedia: Ethylenediamine (abbreviated as en when a ligand) is the organic compound with the formula C2H4(NH2)2. This colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor is a basic amine. It is a widely used building block in chemical synthesis, with approximately 500,000 tonnes produced in 1998. Ethylenediamine is the first member of the so-called polyethylene amines.\n\nSynthesis: Ethylenediamine is produced industrially by treating 1,2-dichloroethane with ammonia under pressure at 180 \u00b0C in an aqueous medium:\n\nIn this reaction hydrogen chloride is generated, which forms a salt with the amine. The amine is liberated by addition of sodium hydroxide and can then be recovered by fractional distillation. Diethylenetriamine (DETA) and triethylenetetramine (TETA) are formed as by-products.\nAnother industrial route to ethylenediamine involves the reaction of ethanolamine and ammonia:\n\nThis process involves passing the gaseous reactants over a bed of nickel heterogeneous catalysts.\nIt can be produced in the lab by the reaction of ethylene glycol and urea.\nEthylenediamine can be purified by treatment with sodium hydroxide to remove water followed by distillation.\n\nApplications: Ethylenediamine is used in large quantities for production of many industrial chemicals. It forms derivatives with carboxylic acids (including fatty acids), nitriles, alcohols (at elevated temperatures), alkylating agents, carbon disulfide, and aldehydes and ketones. Because of its bifunctional nature, having two amino groups, it readily forms heterocycles such as imidazolidines.\n\nPrecursor to chelation agents, drugs, and agrochemicals: A most prominent derivative of ethylenediamine is the chelating agent  EDTA, which is derived from ethylenediamine via a Strecker synthesis involving cyanide and formaldehyde. Hydroxyethylethylenediamine is another commercially significant chelating agent.  Numerous bio-active compounds and drugs contain the N\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013N linkage, including some antihistamines. Salts of ethylenebisdithiocarbamate are commercially significant fungicides under the brand names Maneb, Mancozeb, Zineb, and Metiram. Some imidazoline-containing fungicides are derived from ethylenediamine.\n\nPharmaceutical ingredient: Ethylenediamine is an ingredient in the common bronchodilator drug aminophylline, where it serves to solubilize the active ingredient theophylline. Ethylenediamine has also been used in dermatologic preparations, but has been removed from some because of causing contact dermatitis. When used as a pharmaceutical excipient, after oral administration its bioavailability is about 0.34, due to a substantial first-pass effect. Less than 20% is eliminated by renal excretion.\nEthylenediamine-derived antihistamines are the oldest of the five classes of first-generation antihistamines, beginning with piperoxan aka benodain, discovered in 1933 at the Pasteur Institute in France, and also including mepyramine, tripelennamine, and antazoline. The other classes are derivatives of ethanolamine, alkylamine, piperazine, and others (primarily tricyclic and tetracyclic compounds related to phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, as well as the cyproheptadine-phenindamine family)\n\nRole in polymers: Ethylenediamine, because it contains two amine groups, is a widely used precursor to various polymers. Condensates derived from formaldehyde are plasticizers. It is widely used in the production of polyurethane fibers. The PAMAM class of dendrimers are derived from ethylenediamine.\n\nTetraacetylethylenediamine: The bleaching activator tetraacetylethylenediamine is generated from ethylenediamine. The derivative N,N-ethylenebis(stearamide) (EBS) is a commercially significant mold-release agent and a surfactant in gasoline and motor oil.\n\nOther applications: as a solvent, it is miscible with polar solvents and is used to solubilize proteins such as albumins and casein. It is also used in certain electroplating baths.\nas a corrosion inhibitor in paints and coolants.\nethylenediamine dihydroiodide (EDDI) is added to animal feeds as a source of iodide.\nchemicals for color photography developing, binders, adhesives, fabric softeners, curing agents for epoxies, and dyes.\nas a compound to sensitize nitromethane into an explosive. This mixture was used at Picatinny Arsenal during World War II, giving the nitromethane and ethylenediamine mixture the nickname PLX, or Picatinny Liquid Explosive.\n\nCoordination chemistry: Ethylenediamine is a well-known bidentate chelating ligand for coordination compounds, with the two nitrogen atoms donating their lone pairs of electrons when ethylenediamine acts as a ligand. It is often abbreviated \"en\" in inorganic chemistry. The complex [Co(en)3]3+ is a well studied example. Schiff base ligands easily form from ethylenediamine. For example, the diamine condenses with 4-Trifluoromethylbenzaldehyde to give to the diimine. The salen ligands, some of which are used in catalysis, are derived from the condensation of salicylaldehydes and ethylenediamine.\n\nRelated ligands: Related derivatives of ethylenediamine include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA), and tetraethylethylenediamine (TEEDA). Chiral analogs of ethylenediamine include 1,2-diaminopropane and trans-diaminocyclohexane.\n\nSafety: Ethylenediamine, like ammonia and other low-molecular weight amines, is a skin and respiratory irritant. Unless tightly contained, liquid ethylenediamine will release toxic and irritating vapors into its surroundings, especially on heating. The vapors absorb moisture from humid air to form a characteristic white mist, which is extremely irritating to skin, eyes, lungs and mucous membranes.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links:  Media related to Ethylenediamine at Wikimedia Commons\n\nIRIS EPA Ethylenediamine\nCDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards\nChemical data\n\n\n pubchem:\nEthylenediamine appears as a clear colorless liquid with an ammonia-like odor.

        "text1": "Title: Aspirin\nwikipedia: Aspirin is the genericized trademark for acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to reduce pain, fever, and inflammation, and as an antithrombotic. Specific inflammatory conditions that aspirin is used to treat include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever.\nAspirin is also used long-term to help prevent further heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots in people at high risk. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin works similarly to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.\nOne common adverse effect is an upset stomach. More significant side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, and worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater among those who are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on other blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.\nA precursor to aspirin found in the bark of the willow tree (genus Salix) has been used for its health effects for at least 2,400 years. In 1853, chemist Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt treated the medicine sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time. Over the next 50 years, other chemists, mostly of the German company Bayer, established the chemical structure and devised more efficient production methods.:\u200a69\u201375\u200a Felix Hoffmann (or Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn) of Bayer was the first to produce acetylsalicylic acid in a pure, stable form in 1897. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it globally.:\u200a27\u200a\nAspirin is available without medical prescription as a proprietary or generic medication in most jurisdictions. It is one of the most widely used medications globally, with an estimated 40,000 tonnes (44,000 tons) (50 to 120 billion pills) consumed each year, and is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2022, it was the 36th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 16 million prescriptions.\n\nBrand vs. generic name: In 1897, scientists at the Bayer company began studying acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement medication for common salicylate medicines.:\u200a69\u201375\u200a By 1899, Bayer had named it \"Aspirin\" and was selling it around the world.\nAspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the 20th century, leading to competition between many brands and formulations. The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name; however, its rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. The name is ultimately a blend of the prefix a(cetyl) + spir Spiraea, the meadowsweet plant genus from which the acetylsalicylic acid was originally derived at Bayer + -in, the common chemical suffix.\n\nChemical properties: Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of ammonium acetate or the acetates, carbonates, citrates, or hydroxides of the alkali metals. It is stable in dry air, but gradually hydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.\nLike flour mills, factories producing aspirin tablets must control the amount of the powder that becomes airborne inside the building, because the powder-air mixture can be explosive. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5 mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5 mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.\n\nSynthesis: The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH \u2192 R-OCOCH3). This process yields aspirin and acetic acid, which is considered a byproduct of this reaction. Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. This method is commonly demonstrated in undergraduate teaching labs.\n\nReaction between acetic acid and salicylic acid can also form aspirin but this esterification reaction is reversible and the presence of water can lead to hydrolysis of the aspirin. So, an anhydrous reagent is preferred.\nReaction mechanism\n\nFormulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding salicylic and acetic acids.\n\nPhysical properties: Aspirin, an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance that melts at 136 \u00b0C (277 \u00b0F), and decomposes around 140 \u00b0C (284 \u00b0F). Its acid dissociation constant (pKa) is 3.5 at 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F).\n\nPolymorphism: Polymorphism, or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs receive regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph.\nUntil 2005, there was only one proven polymorph of aspirin (Form I), though the existence of another polymorph was debated since the 1960s, and one report from 1981 reported that when crystallized in the presence of aspirin anhydride, the diffractogram of aspirin has weak additional peaks. Though at the time it was dismissed as mere impurity, it was, in retrospect, Form II aspirin.\nForm II was reported in 2005, found after attempted co-crystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile.\nIn form I, pairs of aspirin molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds. In form II, each aspirin molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds, but with two neighbouring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures. The aspirin polymorphs contain identical 2-dimensional sections and are therefore more precisely described as polytypes.\nPure Form II aspirin could be prepared by seeding the batch with aspirin anhydrate in 15% weight.\nForm III was reported in 2015 by compressing form I above 2 GPa, but it reverts back to Form I when pressure is removed. Form IV was reported in 2017. It is stable at ambient conditions.\n\nMechanism of action: \n\nDiscovery of the mechanism: In 1971, British pharmacologist John Robert Vane, then employed by the Royal College of Surgeons in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, jointly with Sune Bergstr\u00f6m and Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson.\n\nProstaglandins and thromboxanes: Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the cyclooxygenase (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the COX enzyme (Suicide inhibition). This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as diclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors.\nLow-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8\u20139 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks in people who have had a heart attack, unstable angina, ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.\nProstaglandins, local hormones produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form blood clots. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention to prevent a second acute myocardial infarction.\n\nCOX-1 and COX-2 inhibition: At least two different types of cyclooxygenases, COX-1 and COX-2, are acted on by aspirin. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified COX-2 (aka prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 or PTGS2) produces epi-lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory. Newer NSAID drugs, COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only COX-2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.\nSeveral COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been withdrawn from the market, after evidence emerged that COX-2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express COX-2, and, by selectively inhibiting COX-2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as COX-1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new COX-1 once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference as compared with reversible inhibitors.\nFurthermore, aspirin, while inhibiting the ability of COX-2 to form pro-inflammatory products such as the prostaglandins, converts this enzyme's activity from a prostaglandin-forming cyclooxygenase to a lipoxygenase-like enzyme: aspirin-treated COX-2 metabolizes a variety of polyunsaturated fatty acids to hydroperoxy products which are then further metabolized to specialized proresolving mediators such as the aspirin-triggered lipoxins(15-epilipoxin-A4/B4), aspirin-triggered resolvins, and aspirin-triggered maresins. These mediators possess potent anti-inflammatory activity. It is proposed that this aspirin-triggered transition of COX-2 from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase activity and the consequential formation of specialized proresolving mediators contributes to the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin.\n\nAdditional mechanisms: Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signalling through NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.\nAspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.\n\nFormulations: Aspirin is produced in many formulations, with some differences in effect. In particular, aspirin can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, and formulations are sought which deliver the benefits of aspirin while mitigating harmful bleeding. Formulations may be combined (e.g., buffered + vitamin C).\n\nTablets, typically of about 75\u2013100 mg and 300\u2013320 mg of immediate-release aspirin (IR-ASA).\nDispersible tablets.\nEnteric-coated tablets.\nBuffered formulations containing aspirin with one of many buffering agents.\nFormulations of aspirin with vitamin C (ASA-VitC)\nA phospholipid-aspirin complex liquid formulation, PL-ASA. As of 2023 the phospholipid coating was being trialled to determine if it caused less gastrointestinal damage.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell membrane in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionized. Owing to the formation of concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.\nAbout 50\u201380% of salicylate in the blood is bound to human serum albumin, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1\u20130.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.\nAs much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact is referred to as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.\nSalicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid. When small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 h to 4.5 h. When higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15 h to 30 h), because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated. Renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes in urinary pH. A 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance occurs when urine pH is increased from 5 to 8. The use of urinary alkalinization exploits this particular aspect of salicylate elimination. It was found that short-term aspirin use in therapeutic doses might precipitate reversible acute kidney injury when the patient was ill with glomerulonephritis or cirrhosis. Aspirin for some patients with chronic kidney disease and some children with congestive heart failure was contraindicated.\n\nHistory: Medicines made from willow and other salicylate-rich plants appear in clay tablets from ancient Sumer as well as the Ebers Papyrus from ancient Egypt.:\u200a8\u201313\u200a Hippocrates referred to the use of salicylic tea to reduce fevers around 400 BC, and willow bark preparations were part of the pharmacopoeia of Western medicine in classical antiquity and the Middle Ages. Willow bark extract became recognized for its specific effects on fever, pain, and inflammation in the mid-eighteenth century after the Rev Edward Stone of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, noticed that the bitter taste of willow bark resembled the taste of the bark of the cinchona tree, known as \"Peruvian bark\", which was used successfully in Peru to treat a variety of ailments. Stone experimented with preparations of powdered willow bark on people in Chipping Norton for five years and found it to be as effective as Peruvian bark and a cheaper domestic version. In 1763 he sent a report of his findings to the Royal Society in London. By the nineteenth century, pharmacists were experimenting with and prescribing a variety of chemicals related to salicylic acid, the active component of willow extract.:\u200a46\u201355\u200a\n\nIn 1853, chemist Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gerhardt treated sodium salicylate with acetyl chloride to produce acetylsalicylic acid for the first time;:\u200a46\u201348\u200a in the second half of the 19th century, other academic chemists established the compound's chemical structure and devised more efficient methods of synthesis. In 1897, scientists at the drug and dye firm Bayer began investigating acetylsalicylic acid as a less-irritating replacement for standard common salicylate medicines, and identified a new way to synthesize it.:\u200a69\u201375\u200a That year, Felix Hoffmann (or Arthur Eichengr\u00fcn) of Bayer was the first to produce acetylsalicylic acid in a pure, stable form. By 1899, Bayer had dubbed this drug Aspirin and was selling it globally.:\u200a27\u200a The word Aspirin was Bayer's brand name, rather than the generic name of the drug; however, Bayer's rights to the trademark were lost or sold in many countries. Aspirin's popularity grew over the first half of the 20th century leading to fierce competition with the proliferation of aspirin brands and products.\nAspirin's popularity declined after the development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects,:\u200a226\u2013231\u200a while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases.:\u200a247\u2013257\u200a The initial large studies on the use of low-dose aspirin to prevent heart attacks that were published in the 1970s and 1980s helped spur reform in clinical research ethics and guidelines for human subject research and US federal law, and are often cited as examples of clinical trials that included only men, but from which people drew general conclusions that did not hold true for women.\nAspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the 20th century, and remain strong in the 21st century with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.:\u200a267\u2013269\n\nTrademark: Bayer lost its trademark for Aspirin in the United States and some other countries in actions taken between 1918 and 1921 because it had failed to use the name for its own product correctly and had for years allowed the use of \"Aspirin\" by other manufacturers without defending the intellectual property rights. Today, aspirin is a generic trademark in many countries. Aspirin, with a capital \"A\", remains a registered trademark of Bayer in Germany, Canada, Mexico, and in over 80 other countries, for acetylsalicylic acid in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each.\n\nCompendial status: United States Pharmacopeia\nBritish Pharmacopoeia\n\nMedical use: Aspirin is used in the treatment of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown to reduce the risk of death from a heart attack, or the risk of stroke in people who are at high risk or who have cardiovascular disease, but not in elderly people who are otherwise healthy. There is evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear.\n\nPain: Aspirin is an effective analgesic for acute pain, although it is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen because aspirin is more likely to cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric distension, or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.\nAspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats certain types of a headache, but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider. Among primary headaches, the International Classification of Headache Disorders distinguishes between tension headache (the most common), migraine, and cluster headache. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headaches. Aspirin, especially as a component of an aspirin/paracetamol/caffeine combination, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of sumatriptan. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.\n\nFever: Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control fever is due to its action on the prostaglandin system through its irreversible inhibition of COX. Although aspirin's use as an antipyretic in adults is well established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Food and Drug Administration, strongly advise against using aspirin for the treatment of fever in children because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection. Because of the risk of Reye's syndrome in children, in 1986, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required labeling on all aspirin-containing medications advising against its use in children and teenagers.\n\nInflammation: Aspirin is used as an anti-inflammatory agent for both acute and long-term inflammation, as well as for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHeart attacks and strokes: Aspirin is an important part of the treatment of those who have had a heart attack. It is generally not recommended for routine use by people with no other health problems, including those over the age of 70.\nThe 2009 Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration published in Lancet evaluated the efficacy and safety of low dose aspirin in secondary prevention. In those with prior ischaemic stroke or acute myocardial infarction, daily low dose aspirin was associated with a 19% relative risk reduction of serious cardiovascular events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or vascular death). This did come at the expense of a 0.19% absolute risk increase in gastrointestinal bleeding; however, the benefits outweigh the hazard risk in this case. Data from previous trials have suggested that weight-based dosing of aspirin has greater benefits in primary prevention of cardiovascular outcomes. However, more recent trials were not able to replicate similar outcomes using low dose aspirin in low body weight (<70 kg) in specific subset of population studied i.e. elderly and diabetic population, and more evidence is required to study the effect of high dose aspirin in high body weight (\u226570 kg).\nAfter percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), such as the placement of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Duration of DAPT was advised in the United States and European Union guidelines after the CURE and PRODIGY studies. In 2020, the systematic review and network meta-analysis from Khan et al. showed promising benefits of short-term (< 6 months) DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors in selected patients, as well as the benefits of extended-term (> 12 months) DAPT in high risk patients. In conclusion, the optimal duration of DAPT after PCIs should be personalized after outweighing each patient's risks of ischemic events and risks of bleeding events with consideration of multiple patient-related and procedure-related factors. Moreover, aspirin should be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.\nThe status of the use of aspirin for the primary prevention in cardiovascular disease is conflicting and inconsistent, with recent changes from previously recommending it widely decades ago, and that some referenced newer trials in clinical guidelines show less of benefit of adding aspirin alongside other anti-hypertensive and cholesterol lowering therapies. The ASCEND study demonstrated that in high-bleeding risk diabetics with no prior cardiovascular disease, there is no overall clinical benefit (12% decrease in risk of ischaemic events v/s 29% increase in GI bleeding) of low dose aspirin in preventing the serious vascular events over a period of 7.4 years. Similarly, the results of the ARRIVE study also showed no benefit of same dose of aspirin in reducing the time to first cardiovascular outcome in patients with moderate risk of cardiovascular disease over a period of five years. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance. For people who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced. Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify people who are resistant to aspirin.\nAs of April 2022, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) determined that there was a \"small net benefit\" for patients aged 40\u201359 with a 10% or greater 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and \"no net benefit\" for patients aged over 60. Determining the net benefit was based on balancing the risk reduction of taking aspirin for heart attacks and ischaemic strokes, with the increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and hemorrhagic strokes. Their recommendations state that age changes the risk of the medicine, with the magnitude of the benefit of aspirin coming from starting at a younger age, while the risk of bleeding, while small, increases with age, particular for adults over 60, and can be compounded by other risk factors such as diabetes and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. As a result, the USPSTF suggests that \"people ages 40 to 59 who are at higher risk for CVD should decide with their clinician whether to start taking aspirin; people 60 or older should not start taking aspirin to prevent a first heart attack or stroke.\" Primary prevention guidelines from September 2019 made by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association state they might consider aspirin for patients aged 40\u201369 with a higher risk of atherosclerotic CVD, without an increased bleeding risk, while stating they would not recommend aspirin for patients aged over 70 or adults of any age with an increased bleeding risk. They state a CVD risk estimation and a risk discussion should be done before starting on aspirin, while stating aspirin should be used \"infrequently in the routine primary prevention of (atherosclerotic CVD) because of lack of net benefit\". As of August 2021, the European Society of Cardiology made similar recommendations; considering aspirin specifically to patients aged less than 70 at high or very high CVD risk, without any clear contraindications, on a case-by-case basis considering both ischemic risk and bleeding risk.\n\nCancer prevention: Aspirin may reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. There is substantial evidence for lowering the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), but aspirin must be taken for at least 10\u201320 years to see this benefit. It may also slightly reduce the risk of endometrial cancer and prostate cancer.\nSome conclude the benefits are greater than the risks due to bleeding in those at average risk. Others are unclear if the benefits are greater than the risk. Given this uncertainty, the 2007 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines on this topic recommended against the use of aspirin for prevention of CRC in people with average risk. Nine years later however, the USPSTF issued a grade B recommendation for the use of low-dose aspirin (75 to 100 mg/day) \"for the primary prevention of CVD [cardiovascular disease] and CRC in adults 50 to 59 years of age who have a 10% or greater 10-year CVD risk, are not at increased risk for bleeding, have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, and are willing to take low-dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years\".\nA meta-analysis through 2019 said that there was an association between taking aspirin and lower risk of cancer of the colorectum, esophagus, and stomach.\nIn 2021, the U.S. Preventive services Task Force raised questions about the use of aspirin in cancer prevention. It notes the results of the 2018 ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) Trial, in which the risk of cancer-related death was higher in the aspirin-treated group than in the placebo group.\n\nPsychiatry: \n\nBipolar disorder: Aspirin, along with several other agents with anti-inflammatory properties, has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of severe mental disorders. A 2022 systematic review concluded that aspirin exposure reduced the risk of depression in a pooled cohort of three studies (HR 0.624, 95% CI: 0.0503, 1.198, P=0.033). However, further high-quality, longer-duration, double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to determine whether aspirin is an effective add-on treatment for bipolar depression. Thus, notwithstanding the biological rationale, the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain.\n\nDementia: Although cohort and longitudinal studies have shown low-dose aspirin has a greater likelihood of reducing the incidence of dementia, numerous randomized controlled trials have not validated this.\n\nSchizophrenia: Some researchers have speculated the anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin may be beneficial for schizophrenia. Small trials have been conducted but evidence remains lacking.\n\nOther uses: Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen has been shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.\nAlong with rheumatic fever, Kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children in spite of a lack of high quality evidence for its effectiveness.\nLow-dose aspirin supplementation has moderate benefits when used for prevention of pre-eclampsia. This benefit is greater when started in early pregnancy.\nAspirin has also demonstrated anti-tumoral effects, via inhibition of the PTTG1 gene, which is often overexpressed in tumors.\n\nResistance: For some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or insensitivity. One study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant.\nA study in 100 Italian people found, of the apparent 31% aspirin-resistant subjects, only 5% were truly resistant, and the others were noncompliant.\nAnother study of 400 healthy volunteers found no subjects who were truly resistant, but some had \"pseudoresistance, reflecting delayed and reduced drug absorption\".\n\nMeta-analysis and systematic reviews have concluded that laboratory confirmed aspirin resistance confers increased rates of poorer outcomes in cardiovascular and neurovascular diseases. Although the majority of research conducted has surrounded cardiovascular and neurovascular, there is emerging research into the risk of aspirin resistance after orthopaedic surgery where aspirin is used for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Aspirin resistance in orthopaedic surgery, specifically after total hip and knee arthroplasties, is of interest as risk factors for aspirin resistance are also risk factors for venous thromboembolisms and osteoarthritis; the sequelae of requiring a total hip or knee arthroplasty. Some of these risk factors include obesity, advancing age, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and inflammatory diseases.\n\nDosages: Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300 mg in Britain and 325 mg in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, e.g., 75 mg and 81 mg tablets. The 81 mg tablets are commonly called \"baby aspirin\" or \"baby-strength\", because they were originally \u2013 but no longer \u2013 intended to be administered to infants and children. No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75 mg and the 81 mg tablets. The dose required for benefit appears to depend on a person's weight. For those weighing less than 70 kilograms (154 lb), low dose is effective for preventing cardiovascular disease; for patients above this weight, higher doses are required.\nIn general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis, with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever. For the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.\nMarch 2009 recommendations from the USPSTF on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45\u201379 and women aged 55\u201379 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The WHI study of postmenopausal women found that aspirin resulted in a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause, though there was no significant difference between 81 mg and 325 mg aspirin doses. The 2021 ADAPTABLE study also showed no significant difference in cardiovascular events or major bleeding between 81 mg and 325 mg doses of aspirin in patients (both men and women) with established cardiovascular disease.\nLow-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81 mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for people requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.\nIn children with Kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.\n\nAdverse effects: In October 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the drug label to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy. One exception to the recommendation is the use of low-dose 81 mg aspirin at any point in pregnancy under the direction of a health care professional.\n\nContraindications: Aspirin should not be taken by people who are allergic to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. Aspirin taken at doses of \u2264325 mg and \u2264100 mg per day for \u22652 days can increase the odds of suffering a gout attack by 81% and 91% respectively. This effect may potentially be worsened by high purine diets, diuretics, and kidney disease, but is eliminated by the urate lowering drug allopurinol. Daily low dose aspirin does not appear to worsen kidney function. Aspirin may reduce cardiovascular risk in those without established cardiovascular disease in people with moderate CKD, without significantly increasing the risk of bleeding. Aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents under the age of 16 to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.\n\nGastrointestinal: Aspirin increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Enteric coating on aspirin may be used in manufacturing to prevent release of aspirin into the stomach to reduce gastric harm, but enteric coating does not reduce gastrointestinal bleeding risk. Enteric-coated aspirin may not be as effective at reducing blood clot risk. Combining aspirin with other NSAIDs has been shown to further increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\nBlockade of COX-1 by aspirin apparently results in the upregulation of COX-2 as part of a gastric defense. There is no clear evidence that simultaneous use of a COX-2 inhibitor with aspirin may increase the risk of gastrointestinal injury.\n\"Buffering\" is an additional method used with the intent to mitigate  gastrointestinal bleeding, such as by preventing aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses magnesium oxide. Other preparations use calcium carbonate. Gas-forming agents in effervescent tablet and powder formulations can also double as a buffering agent, one example being sodium bicarbonate, used in Alka-Seltzer.\nTaking vitamin C with aspirin has been investigated as a method of protecting the stomach lining. In trials vitamin C-releasing aspirin (ASA-VitC) or a buffered aspirin formulation containing vitamin C was found to cause less stomach damage than aspirin alone.\n\nRetinal vein occlusion: It is a widespread habit among eye specialists (ophthalmologists) to prescribe aspirin as an add-on medication for patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), such as central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The reason of this widespread use is the evidence of its proven effectiveness in major systemic venous thrombotic disorders, and it has been assumed that may be similarly beneficial in various types of retinal vein occlusion.\nHowever, a large-scale investigation based on data of nearly 700 patients showed \"that aspirin or other antiplatelet aggregating agents or anticoagulants adversely influence the visual outcome in patients with CRVO and hemi-CRVO, without any evidence of protective or beneficial effect\". Several expert groups, including the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, recommended against the use of antithrombotic drugs (incl. aspirin) for patients with RVO.\n\nCentral effects: Large doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, cause temporary tinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action on arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade.\n\nReye's syndrome: Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 to 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The US Food and Drug Administration recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the UK National Health Service recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.\n\nSkin: For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms including hives, swelling, and headache. Aspirin can exacerbate symptoms among those with chronic hives, or create acute symptoms of hives. These responses can be due to allergic reactions to aspirin, or more often due to its effect of inhibiting the COX-1 enzyme. Skin reactions may also tie to systemic contraindications, seen with NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm, or those with atopy.\nAspirin and other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may delay the healing of skin wounds. Earlier findings from two small, low-quality trials suggested a benefit with aspirin (alongside compression therapy) on venous leg ulcer healing time and leg ulcer size, however larger, more recent studies of higher quality have been unable to corroborate these outcomes. As such, further research is required to clarify the role of aspirin in this context.\n\nOther adverse effects: Aspirin can induce swelling of skin tissues in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the people. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these people; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.\nAspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds, having the appearance on MRI scans of 5 to 10 mm or smaller, hypointense (dark holes) patches.\nA study of a group with a mean dosage of aspirin of 270 mg per day estimated an average absolute risk increase in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of 12 events per 10,000 persons. In comparison, the estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction was 137 events per 10,000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10,000 persons in ischemic stroke. In cases where ICH already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of about 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ICH around 2.5 (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).\nAspirin and other NSAIDs can cause abnormally high blood levels of potassium by inducing a hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.\nUse of low-dose aspirin before a surgical procedure has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding events in some patients, however, ceasing aspirin prior to surgery has also been associated with an increase in major adverse cardiac events. An analysis of multiple studies found a three-fold increase in adverse events such as myocardial infarction in patients who ceased aspirin prior to surgery. The analysis found that the risk is dependent on the type of surgery being performed and the patient indication for aspirin use.\nOn 9 July 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) toughened warnings of increased heart attack and stroke risk associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings.\n\nOverdose: Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a mortality rate of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children. Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including activated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis. The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30 to 100 mg/L after usual therapeutic doses, 50\u2013300 mg/L in people taking high doses and 700\u20131400 mg/L following acute overdose. Salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure to bismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate, and sodium salicylate.\n\nInteractions: Aspirin is known to interact with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, an important part of valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, may reduce the antiplatelet effect of aspirin. Although limited evidence suggests this may not result in a reduced cardioprotective effect of aspirin. Analgesic doses of aspirin decrease sodium loss induced by spironolactone in the urine, however this does not reduce the antihypertensive effects of spironolactone. Furthermore, antiplatelet doses of aspirin are deemed too small to produce an interaction with spironolactone. Aspirin is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.\n\nResearch: The ISIS-2 trial demonstrated that aspirin at doses of 160 mg daily for one month, decreased the mortality by 21% of participants with a suspected myocardial infarction in the first five weeks. A single daily dose of 324 mg of aspirin for 12 weeks has a highly protective effect against acute myocardial infarction and death in men with unstable angina.\n\nBipolar disorder: Aspirin has been repurposed as an add-on treatment for depressive episodes in subjects with bipolar disorder. However, meta-analytic evidence is based on very few studies and does not suggest any efficacy of aspirin in the treatment of bipolar depression. Thus, notwithstanding the biological rationale, the clinical perspectives of aspirin and anti-inflammatory agents in the treatment of bipolar depression remain uncertain.\n\nInfectious diseases: Several studies investigated the anti-infective properties of aspirin for bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. Aspirin was demonstrated to limit platelet activation induced by Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis and to reduce streptococcal adhesion to heart valves. In patients with tuberculous meningitis, the addition of aspirin reduced the risk of new cerebral infarction [RR = 0.52 (0.29-0.92)]. A role of aspirin on bacterial and fungal biofilm is also being supported by growing evidence.\n\nCancer prevention: Evidence from observational studies was conflicting on the effect of aspirin in breast cancer prevention; a randomized controlled trial showed that aspirin had no significant effect in reducing breast cancer, thus further studies are needed to clarify the effect of aspirin in cancer prevention.\n\nIn gardening: There are many anecdotal reportings that aspirin can improve plant's growth and resistance though most research involved salicylic acid instead of aspirin.\n\nVeterinary medicine: Aspirin is sometimes used in veterinary medicine as an anticoagulant or to relieve pain associated with musculoskeletal inflammation or osteoarthritis. Aspirin should be given to animals only under the direct supervision of a veterinarian, as adverse effects\u2014including gastrointestinal issues\u2014are common. An aspirin overdose in any species may result in salicylate poisoning, characterized by hemorrhaging, seizures, coma, and even death.\nDogs are better able to tolerate aspirin than cats are. Cats metabolize aspirin slowly because they lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making it potentially toxic if dosing is not spaced out properly. No clinical signs of toxicosis occurred when cats were given 25 mg/kg of aspirin every 48 hours for 4 weeks, but the recommended dose for relief of pain and fever and for treating blood clotting diseases in cats is 10 mg/kg every 48 hours to allow for metabolization.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: \n\nExternal links:  Media related to Aspirin at Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n pubchem:\nAspirin can cause developmental toxicity and female reproductive toxicity according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\nAcetylsalicylic acid appears as odorless white crystals or crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste. (NTP, 1992)\nAcetylsalicylic acid is a member of the class of benzoic acids that is salicylic acid in which the hydrogen that is attached to the phenolic hydroxy group has been replaced by an acetoxy group. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with cyclooxygenase inhibitor activity. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, an antipyretic, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a prostaglandin antagonist, a teratogenic agent, an anticoagulant, a plant activator, an EC 1.1.1.188 (prostaglandin-F synthase) inhibitor, a drug allergen and a geroprotector. It is a member of benzoic acids, a member of salicylates and a member of phenyl acetates. It is functionally related to a salicylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an acetylsalicylate.\nAlso known as Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. Acetylsalicylic acid has both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects.  This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI).    Interestingly, the results of various studies have demonstrated that long-term use of acetylsalicylic acid may decrease the risk of various cancers, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, lung, prostate, liver and skin cancer. Aspirin is classified as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor and is available in many doses and forms, including chewable tablets, suppositories, extended release formulations, and others.   Acetylsalicylic acid is a very common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. It should be kept out of reach from young children, toddlers, and infants.\nAspirin is a Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug and Platelet Aggregation Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of aspirin is as a Cyclooxygenase Inhibitor. The physiologic effect of aspirin is by means of Decreased Prostaglandin Production and Decreased Platelet Aggregation.\nAspirin or acetylsalicylic acid is perhaps the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic medication worldwide, having been in clinical use for over 100 years. Aspirin can cause several forms of liver injury: in high doses, aspirin can cause moderate to marked serum aminotransferase elevations occasionally with jaundice or signs of liver dysfunction, and in lower doses in susceptible children with a febrile illness aspirin can lead to Reye syndrome.\nAspirin has been reported in Brassica napus, Ixora coccinea, and Glycyrrhiza glabra with data available.\nAspirin is an orally administered non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent. Acetylsalicylic acid binds to and acetylates serine residues in cyclooxygenases, resulting in decreased synthesis of prostaglandin, platelet aggregation, and inflammation. This agent exhibits analgesic, antipyretic, and anticoagulant properties.\nASPIRIN is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV (across all indications) that was first approved in 1950 and has 19 approved and 143 investigational indications.\nAcetylsalicylic acid (acetosal) or aspirin is only found in individuals who have consumed this drug. Acetylsalicylic acid is a drug in the family of salicylates, often used as an analgesic (against minor pains and aches), antipyretic (against fever), and anti-inflammatory. It has also an anticoagulant effect and is used in long-term low-doses to prevent heart attacks and cancer. It was isolated from meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria, formerly classified as Spiraea ulmaria) by German researchers in 1839. While their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as irritated stomach and diarrhoea, and even death when consumed in high doses. In 1853, a French chemist named Charles Frederic Gerhardt neutralized salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride, creating acetosalicylic anhydride. Gerhardt's product worked, but he had no desire to market it and abandoned his discovery. In 1897, researcher Arthur Eichengrun and Felix Hoffmann, a research assistant at Friedrich Bayer & Co. in Germany, derivatized one of the hydroxyl functional groups in salicylic acid with an acetyl group (forming the acetyl ester), which greatly reduced the negative effects. This was the first synthetic drug, not a copy of something that existed in nature, and the start of the pharmaceuticals industry. The name 'aspirin' is composed of a- (from the acetyl group) -spir- (from the plant genus Spiraea) and -in (a common ending for drugs at the time). It has also been stated that the name originated by another means. As referring to AcetylSalicylic and 'pir' in reference to one of the scientists who was able to isolate it in crystalline form, Raffaele Piria. Finally 'in' due to the same reasons as stated above. Salicylic acid (which is a naturally occurring substance found in many plants) can be acetylated using acetic anhydride, yielding aspirin and acetic acid as a byproduct. It is a common experiment performed in organic chemistry labs, and generally tends to produce low yields due to the relative difficulty of its extraction from an aqueous state. The trick to getting the reaction to work is to acidify with phosphoric acid and heat the reagents under reflux with a boiling water bath for between 40 minutes and an hour. Aspirin acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis.

        "text2": "Title: Tolbutamide\nwikipedia: Tolbutamide is a first-generation potassium channel blocker, sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic medication. This drug may be used in the management of type 2 diabetes if diet alone is not effective. Tolbutamide stimulates the secretion of insulin by the pancreas.\nIt is not routinely used due to a higher incidence of adverse effects compared to newer, second-generation sulfonylureas, such as Glibenclamide. It generally has a short duration of action due to its rapid metabolism, so is safe for use in older people.\nIt was discovered in 1956.\n\nSide effects: Side effects include:\n\nHypoglycemia\nWeight gain\nHypersensitivity: cross-allergicity with sulfonamides\nDrug interactions (especially first-generation drugs): Increased hypoglycemia with cimetidine, insulin, salicylates, and sulfonamides\nSalicylates displace tolbutamide from its binding site on plasma binding proteins which lead to increase in free tolbutamide concentration, thus hypoglycemic shock.\n\nHistory: Orinase was developed by Upjohn Co. at a time when the primary medical treatment for diabetes was insulin injections.  Eli Lilly had a lock on the market for insulin production at the time. The practical applicability of Orinase, like that of other treatments for disease states detected by paraclinical signs (such as lab test results) rather than clinically observable signs or patient-reported symptoms, benefited from increased sensitivity and availability of testing (in this instance, urinary glucose testing and later also fingerstick blood glucose testing).  Milton Moskowitz (editor in 1961 of Drug and Cosmetic Industry) claimed that the introduction of Orinase, \"expanded the total market by bringing under medical care diabetics who were formerly not treated.\"  It did this by changing the mindset about diabetes even more than insulin had.  Treatment of this chronic disease was no longer seen as a mere slowing of \"inexorable degeneration\", but instead viewed through \"a model of surveillance and early detection.\":\u200a84\u200a\nOrinase and other sulfonylureas emerged from European pharmaceutical research into antibiotics, specifically from attempts to develop sulfa compounds. One of the contenders for a new sulfa antibiotic had serious side effects during clinical trials at the University of Montpellier including blackouts, convulsions, and coma, side effects not observed with any other drugs in the sulfa cohort. An insulin researcher at the same university heard of these side effects and recognized them as common results of hypoglycemia. The resulting class of drugs for lowering blood sugar came to be known as the sulfonylureas, starting with Orinase and still in use today in other forms.\nUnfortunately for diabetics dependent on insulin as a treatment for their condition, this research at Montpellier occurred in the early 1940s and was significantly disrupted by the German occupation of France during World War II.  Development of these compounds was taken over by German pharmaceutical companies, which were obviously disinclined to share their bounty with nations upon which they were waging war.  The German research was, in turn, disrupted by Germany's defeat in 1945 and the partition of Germany into East and West Germany. The sulfonylureas were trapped in East Germany.  In 1952, someone smuggled a sample to a West German pharmaceutical company and research resumed. Clinical trials in diabetics began in 1954 in Berlin. In 1956, two different sulfonylureas were brought to market in Germany under the trade names Nadisan and Rastinon. American pharmaceutical companies in the postwar period had been seeking to establish business relations with the remnants of German pharmaceutical giants weakened by the war and partition of Germany.  Upjohn (based in Kalamazoo until its purchase by Pharmacia in the 1990s) made deals with Hoechst, maker of Rastinon.  The result was a cross-licensing agreement which produced Orinase.\nUpjohn stood to open up a whole new arena of treatment for diabetes, one with a built-in and sustainable market, i.e. patient population. Just as two German companies brought sulfonylureas to market within the same year, Upjohn discovered Eli Lilly had begun clinical trials for carbutamide, another oral hypoglycemic. Upjohn pushed for large-scale clinical trials from 1955\u20131957, enrolling over 5,000 patients at multiple sites.\nUpjohn's formulation was preferred when the Lilly formulation demonstrated evidence of toxicity in parallel trials at the Joslin Clinic. Lilly pulled carbutamide and halted development, leaving the field open for Upjohn to market its new treatment. In 1956, Upjohn filed for approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Jeremy A. Greene found the application's size \u2013 10,580 pages in 23 volumes with 5,786 cases reports \u2013 was necessary to \"render visible the relatively small improvements provided in less severe forms of diabetes.\" Indeed, Orinase was marketed by Upjohn not as a cure-all for all diabetics, but specifically as a treatment that was \"not an oral insulin\" and \"did not work in all diabetics\". Those were the instructions for marketing given to Upjohn's salespeople. As indicated by the FDA application, Orinase had been demonstrated \"not to be effective in severe diabetes, but only in milder cases of the disease.\":\u200a93\u200a Orinase was one of a new class of drugs (including treatments for hypertension and hypercholesterolemia) aimed at providing marginal benefits over existing treatments for patients who had not previously been a target market for pharmaceuticals.\nAs blood sugar testing for diagnosis of diabetes became more widespread, a curious side effect occurred: because blood sugar testing is not absolutely definitive in diagnoses of diabetes, more  people were receiving borderline tests regarding their glycemic status. These borderline persons could be considered as being at risk for diabetes \u2013 prediabetic. Prediabetic patients have elevated blood sugar, but normal levels of sugar in their urine (glycosuria). Upjohn saw an opportunity to benefit and definitely market to a yet-greater expansion of the diabetic population, beyond even the \"hidden diabetics\" revealed by earlier public health campaigns. Upjohn also found a new use for Orinase: as a diagnostic. Orinase Diagnostic was added to the Orinase product line and, by 1962, was being sold as means of detecting prediabetes in that an abnormal response to Orinase following administration of cortisone in a \"stress test\" could be taken to indicate prediabetes. Orinase thus not only served to detect a previously hidden patient population, but also detected a patient population most likely to be interested in Orinase as a treatment for their newly diagnosed prediabetes. By the late 1960s, Orinase Diagnostic was withdrawn and the drug reverted to its therapeutic purpose. By that point, prediabetes had become a diagnosable and treatable condition which had dramatically increased the market for Orinase.\nOrinase began to fall out of favor in May 1970 when asymptomatic prediabetics on long-term regimens of Orinase began to see news reports (beginning with the Washington Post) that Orinase may have serious side effects including death from cardiovascular problems, according to a long-term study. In many cases, patients learned of this before their physicians, and also before FDA could advise relabeling the medication or suggesting alterations in appropriate usage. The question of whether Orinase did or did not increase cardiovascular problems has not been conclusively settled. The result was that Orinase and other medical treatments for prediabetes were \"rolled back\" by the FDA and practitioners in an attempt to focus on symptomatic patients for whom the risks of treatment might be balanced by the symptoms of the disease.  \nPharmacia and Upjohn (now merged) stopped making Orinase in 2000, though a generic is still available and occasionally used.\n\nHistorical consequences: The history of tolbutamide has had a lasting effect on medicine and the pharmaceutical industry. Patients today are still diagnosed with prediabetes, many of them managing to delay the onset of diabetes through dietary and lifestyle changes, but many also have the option to take metformin, which demonstrated a 31% reduction in three-year incidence of development of diabetes relative to placebo. While impressive, the lifestyle-modification arm of that same trial demonstrated a 58% reduction.\n\nSee also: Chlorpropamide\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nTolbutamide appears as white crystals. (NTP, 1992)\nTolbutamide is an N-sulfonylurea that consists of 1-butylurea having a tosyl group attached at the 3-position. It has a role as a hypoglycemic agent, a potassium channel blocker, a human metabolite and an insulin secretagogue.\nTolbutamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating \u03b2 cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic \u03b2 cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver. Tolbutamide and its metabolites are excreted in urine (75-85%) and feces.\nTolbutamide is a Sulfonylurea.\nTolbutamide has been reported in Homo sapiens with data available.\nTolbutamide is a short-acting, first-generation sulfonylurea with hypoglycemic activity.

        "text2": "Title: Dimethyl Sulfoxide\nwikipedia: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an organosulfur compound with the formula (CH3)2SO.  This colorless liquid is the sulfoxide most widely used commercially. It is an important polar aprotic solvent that dissolves both polar and nonpolar compounds and is miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water.  It has a relatively high boiling point.  DMSO is metabolised to compounds that leave a garlic-like taste in the mouth after DMSO is absorbed by skin.\nIn terms of chemical structure, the molecule has idealized Cs symmetry. It has a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry consistent with other three-coordinate S(IV) compounds, with a nonbonded electron pair on the approximately tetrahedral sulfur atom.\n\nSynthesis and production: Dimethyl sulfoxide was first synthesized in 1866 by the Russian scientist Alexander Zaytsev, who reported his findings in 1867.  Its modern use as an industrial solvent began through popularization by Thor Smedslund at the Stepan Chemical Company.  Dimethyl sulfoxide is produced industrially from dimethyl sulfide, a by-product of the Kraft process, by oxidation with oxygen or nitrogen dioxide.\n\nReactions: \n\nReactions with electrophiles: The sulfur center in DMSO is nucleophilic toward soft electrophiles and the oxygen is nucleophilic toward hard electrophiles.  With methyl iodide it forms trimethylsulfoxonium iodide, [(CH3)3SO]I:\n\n(CH3)2SO  +  CH3I  \u2192  [(CH3)3SO]I\nThis salt can be deprotonated with sodium hydride to form the sulfur ylide:\n\n[(CH3)3SO]I  +  NaH  \u2192 (CH3)2S(CH2)O  +  NaI  +  H2\n\nAcidity: The methyl groups of DMSO are only weakly acidic, with a pKa = 35.  For this reason, the basicities of many weakly basic organic compounds have been examined in this solvent.\nDeprotonation of DMSO requires strong bases like lithium diisopropylamide and sodium hydride.  Stabilization of the resultant carbanion is provided by the S(O)R group.  The sodium derivative of DMSO formed in this way is referred to as dimsyl sodium.  It is a base, e.g., for the deprotonation of ketones to form sodium enolates, phosphonium salts to form Wittig reagents, and formamidinium salts to form diaminocarbenes.  It is also a potent nucleophile.\n\nOxidant: In organic synthesis, DMSO is used as a mild oxidant. It forms the basis of several selective sulfonium-based oxidation reactions including the Pfitzner\u2013Moffatt oxidation, Corey\u2013Kim oxidation and the Swern oxidation. The Kornblum oxidation is conceptually similar. These all involve formation of an intermediate sulfonium species (R2S+X where X is a heteroatom)\n\nLigand and Lewis base: Related to its ability to dissolve many salts, DMSO is a common ligand in coordination chemistry. Illustrative is the complex dichlorotetrakis(dimethyl sulfoxide)ruthenium(II) (RuCl2(dmso)4). In this complex, three DMSO ligands are bonded to ruthenium through sulfur. The fourth DMSO is bonded through oxygen. In general, the oxygen-bonded mode is more common.\nIn carbon tetrachloride solutions DMSO functions as a Lewis base with a variety of Lewis acids such as I2, phenols, trimethyltin chloride, metalloporphyrins, and the dimer Rh2Cl2(CO)4. The donor properties are discussed in the ECW model. The relative donor strength of DMSO toward a series of acids, versus other Lewis bases, can be illustrated by C-B plots.\n\nApplications: \n\nSolvent: DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent and is less toxic than other members of this class, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA). DMSO is frequently used as a solvent for chemical reactions involving salts, most notably Finkelstein reactions and other nucleophilic substitutions. It is also extensively used as an extractant in biochemistry and cell biology. Because DMSO is only weakly acidic, it tolerates relatively strong bases and as such has been extensively used in the study of carbanions.  A set of non-aqueous pKa values (C-H, O-H, S-H and N-H acidities) for thousands of organic compounds have been determined in DMSO solution.\nBecause of its high boiling point, 189 \u00b0C (372 \u00b0F), DMSO evaporates slowly at normal atmospheric pressure. Samples dissolved in DMSO cannot as easily be recovered compared to other solvents, as it is very difficult to remove all traces of DMSO by conventional rotary evaporation. One technique to fully recover samples is removal of the organic solvent by evaporation followed by addition of water (to dissolve DMSO) and cryodesiccation to remove both DMSO and water. Reactions conducted in DMSO are often diluted with water to precipitate or phase-separate products. The relatively high freezing point of DMSO, 18.5 \u00b0C (65.3 \u00b0F), means that at, or just below, room temperature it is a solid, which can limit its utility in some chemical processes (e.g. crystallization with cooling).\nIn its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), it is a useful solvent for NMR spectroscopy, again due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of analytes, the simplicity of its own spectrum, and its suitability for high-temperature NMR spectroscopic studies. Disadvantages to the use of DMSO-d6 are its high viscosity, which broadens signals, and its hygroscopicity, which leads to an overwhelming H2O resonance in the 1H-NMR spectrum. It is often mixed with CDCl3 or CD2Cl2 for lower viscosity and melting points.\n\nDMSO is used to dissolve test compounds in in vitro drug discovery and drug design screening programs, including high-throughput screening programs.  This is because it is able to dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds, can be used to maintain stock solutions of test compounds (important when working with a large chemical library), is readily miscible with water and cell culture media, and has a high boiling point (this improves the accuracy of test compound concentrations by reducing room temperature evaporation).  One limitation with DMSO is that it can affect cell line growth and viability, with low DMSO concentrations sometimes stimulating cell growth, and high DMSO concentrations sometimes inhibiting or killing cells.\nDMSO is used as a vehicle in in vivo studies of test compounds.  It has, for example, been employed as a co-solvent to assist absorption of the flavonol glycoside Icariin in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans.  As with its use in in vitro studies, DMSO has some limitations in animal models. Pleiotropic effects can occur and, if DMSO control groups are not carefully planned, then solvent effects can falsely be attributed to the prospective drug. For example, even a very low dose of DMSO has a powerful protective effect against paracetamol (acetaminophen)-induced liver injury in mice.\nDMSO is finding increased use in manufacturing processes to produce microelectronic devices. It is widely used to strip photoresist in TFT-LCD 'flat panel' displays and advanced packaging applications (such as wafer-level packaging / solder bump patterning). DMSO is an effective paint stripper, being safer than many of the others such as nitromethane and dichloromethane.\n\nBiology: DMSO is used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to inhibit secondary structures in the DNA template or the DNA primers. It is added to the PCR mix before reacting, where it interferes with the self-complementarity of the DNA, minimizing interfering reactions.\nDMSO in a PCR is applicable for supercoiled plasmids (to relax before amplification) or DNA templates with high GC-content (to decrease thermostability). For example, 10% final concentration of DMSO in the PCR mixture with Phusion decreases primer annealing temperature (i.e. primer melting temperature) by 5.5\u20136.0 \u00b0C (9.9\u201310.8 \u00b0F).\nIt is well known as a reversible cell cycle arrester at phase G1 of human lymphoid cells.\nDMSO may also be used as a cryoprotectant, added to cell media to reduce ice formation and thereby prevent cell death during the freezing process. Approximately 10% may be used with a slow-freeze method, and the cells may be frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C (\u2212112 \u00b0F) or stored in liquid nitrogen safely.\nIn cell culture, DMSO is used to induce differentiation of P19 embryonic carcinoma cells into cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells.\n\nMedicine: Use of DMSO in medicine dates from around 1963, when an Oregon Health & Science University Medical School team, headed by Stanley Jacob, discovered it could penetrate the skin and other membranes without damaging them and could carry other compounds into a biological system. In medicine, DMSO is predominantly used as a topical analgesic, a vehicle for topical application of pharmaceuticals, as an anti-inflammatory, and an antioxidant. Because DMSO increases the rate of absorption of some compounds through biological tissues, including skin, it is used in some transdermal drug delivery systems.  Its effect may be enhanced with the addition of EDTA. It is frequently compounded with antifungal medications, enabling them to penetrate not just skin but also toenails and fingernails.\nDMSO has been examined for the treatment of numerous conditions and ailments, but the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its use only for the symptomatic relief of patients with interstitial cystitis. A 1978 study concluded that DMSO brought significant relief to the majority of the 213 patients with inflammatory genitourinary disorders that were studied. The authors recommended DMSO for genitourinary inflammatory conditions not caused by infection or tumor in which symptoms were severe or patients failed to respond to conventional therapy.\nIn interventional radiology, DMSO is used as a solvent for ethylene vinyl alcohol in the Onyx liquid embolic agent, which is used in embolization, the therapeutic occlusion of blood vessels.\nIn cryobiology DMSO has been used as a cryoprotectant and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. Without it, up to 90% of frozen cells will become inactive. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10% DMSO, a freezing medium, and 30% fetal bovine serum. In the cryogenic freezing of heteroploid cell lines (MDCK, VERO, etc.) a mixture of 10% DMSO with 90% EMEM (70% EMEM + 30% fetal bovine serum + antibiotic mixture) is used. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own hematopoietic stem cells.\nDMSO is metabolized by disproportionation to dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl sulfone. It is subject to renal and pulmonary excretion. A possible side effect of DMSO is therefore elevated blood dimethyl sulfide, which may cause a blood borne halitosis symptom.\n\nAlternative medicine: DMSO's popularity as an alternative medicine is stated to stem from a March 1980 60 Minutes documentary \"The Riddle of DMSO\" and April 1980 Time magazine article covering the treatments of ardent DMSO advocate Dr. Stanley Jacob beginning in the 1960s.\nThe use of DMSO as an alternative treatment for cancer is of particular concern, as it has been shown to interfere with a variety of chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin. There is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that DMSO has any effect, and most sources agree that its history of side effects when tested warrants caution when using it as a dietary supplement, for which it is marketed heavily with the usual disclaimer. DMSO is an ingredient in some products listed by the U.S. FDA as fake cancer cures and the FDA has had a running battle with distributors. One such distributor is Mildred Miller, who promoted DMSO for a variety of disorders and was consequently convicted of Medicare fraud.\n\nVeterinary medicine: DMSO is commonly used in veterinary medicine as a liniment for horses, alone or in combination with other ingredients.  In the latter case, often, the intended function of the DMSO is as a solvent, to carry the other ingredients across the skin.  Also in horses, DMSO is used intravenously, again alone or in combination with other drugs.  It is used alone for the treatment of increased intracranial pressure and/or cerebral edema in horses.\n\nTaste: The perceived garlic taste upon skin contact with DMSO may be due to nonolfactory activation of TRPA1 receptors in trigeminal ganglia.  Unlike dimethyl and diallyl disulfides (which have odors resembling garlic), mono- and tri- sulfides (which typically have foul odors), and similar odiferous sulfur compounds, the pure chemical DMSO is odorless.\n\nSafety: \n\nToxicity: DMSO is a non-toxic solvent with a median lethal dose higher than ethanol (DMSO: LD50, oral, rat, 14,500 mg/kg; ethanol: LD50, oral, rat, 7,060 mg/kg).\nDMSO can cause contaminants, toxins, and medicines to be absorbed through the skin, which may cause unexpected effects. DMSO is thought to increase the effects of blood thinners, steroids, heart medicines, sedatives, and other drugs. In some cases this could be harmful or dangerous.\nBecause DMSO easily penetrates the skin, substances dissolved in DMSO may quickly be absorbed. Glove selection is important when working with DMSO. Butyl rubber, fluoroelastomer, neoprene, or thick (15 mil / 0.4 mm) latex gloves are recommended. Nitrile gloves, which are very commonly used in chemical laboratories, may protect from brief contact but have been found to degrade rapidly with exposure to DMSO.\n\nRegulation: In Australia, it is listed as a Schedule 4 (S4) Drug, and a company has been prosecuted for adding it to products as a preservative.\n\nClinical safety: Early clinical trials with DMSO were stopped because of questions about its safety, especially its ability to harm the eye. The most commonly reported side effects include headaches and burning and itching on contact with the skin. Strong allergic reactions have been reported.\nOn September 9, 1965, The Wall Street Journal reported that a manufacturer of the chemical warned that the death of an Irish woman after undergoing DMSO treatment for a sprained wrist may have been due to the treatment, although no autopsy was done, nor was a causal relationship established. Clinical research using DMSO was halted and did not begin again until the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) published findings in favor of DMSO in 1972.  In 1978, the US FDA approved DMSO for treating interstitial cystitis.  In 1980, the US Congress held hearings on claims that the FDA was slow in approving DMSO for other medical uses.  In 2007, the US FDA granted \"fast track\" designation on clinical studies of DMSO's use in reducing brain tissue swelling following traumatic brain injury.\nDMSO exposure to developing mouse brains can produce brain degeneration. This neurotoxicity could be detected at doses as low as 0.3 mL/kg, a level exceeded in children exposed to DMSO during bone marrow transplant.\n\nOdor problem: DMSO disposed into sewers can cause odor problems in municipal effluents: waste water bacteria transform DMSO under hypoxic (anoxic) conditions into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that has a strong disagreeable odor, similar to rotten cabbage. However, chemically pure DMSO is odorless because of the lack of C-S-C (sulfide) and C-S-H (mercaptan) linkages. Deodorization of DMSO is achieved by removing the odorous impurities it contains.\n\nExplosion hazard: Dimethyl sulfoxide can produce an explosive reaction when exposed to acyl chlorides; at a low temperature, this reaction produces the oxidant for Swern oxidation.\nDMSO can decompose at the boiling temperature of 189 \u00b0C at normal pressure, possibly leading to an explosion. The decomposition is catalyzed by acids and bases and therefore can be relevant at even lower temperatures. A strong to explosive reaction also takes place in combination with halogen compounds, metal nitrides, metal perchlorates, sodium hydride, periodic acid and fluorinating agents.\n\nSee also: Varying oxidation of sulfur\nDimethyl sulfide (DMS), the corresponding sulfide, also produced by marine phytoplankton and emitted to the oceanic atmosphere where it is oxidized to DMSO, SO2 and sulfate\nDimethyl sulfone, commonly known as methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), a related chemical often marketed as a dietary supplement\nRelated compounds with methyl on oxygen\nDimethyl sulfite, the corresponding sulfite\nDimethyl sulfate (also DMS), the corresponding sulfate: a mutagenic alkylating compound\nMethyl methanesulfonate, another methylating agent\nDeath of Gloria Ramirez, where DMSO taken by a terminally ill patient caused medical staff to fall ill\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \nInternational Chemical Safety Card 0459\nDimethyl Sulfoxide Information Center\n\n\n pubchem:\nDimethyl sulfoxide appears as a clear liquid, essentially odorless.

It is less toxic than other members of this class: dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, HMPA. Dimethyl sulfoxide is the chemical compound (CH3)2SO. This colorless liquid is an important dipolar aprotic solvent. It is readily miscible in a wide range of organic solvents as well as water. It has a distinctive property of penetrating the skin very readily, allowing the handler to taste it. Some describe it as an oyster-like taste, others claim it tastes like garlic. DMSO is also employed as a rinsing agent in the electronics industry and, in its deuterated form (DMSO-d6), is a useful solvent in NMR due to its ability to dissolve a wide range of chemical compounds and its minimal interference with the sample signals. In cryobiology DMSO has been used as a cryoprotectant and is still an important constituent of cryoprotectant vitrification mixtures used to preserve organs, tissues, and cell suspensions. It is particularly important in the freezing and long-term storage of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cell, which are often frozen in a mixture of 10% DMSO and 90% fetal calf serum. As part of an autologous bone marrow transplant the DMSO is re-infused along with the patient's own hematopoietic stem cell. Dimethyl sulfoxide is a by-product of wood pulping. One of the leading suppliers of DMSO is the Gaylord company in the USA. DMSO is frequently used as solvent in a number of chemical reactions. In particular it is an excellent reaction solvent for SN2 alkylations: it is possible to alkylate indoles with very high yields using potassium hydroxide as the base and a similar reaction also occurs with phenols. DMSO can be reacted with methyl iodide to form a sulfoxonium ion which can be reacted with sodium hydride to form a sulfur ylide. The methyl groups of DMSO are somewhat acidic in character (pKa=35) due to the stabilization of the resultant anions by the sulfoxide group.\nA highly polar organic liquid, that is used widely as a chemical solvent.

        "text2": "Title: Tetrafluoroethylene\nwikipedia: Tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) is a fluorocarbon with the chemical formula C2F4. It is the simplest perfluorinated alkene. This gaseous species is used primarily in the industrial preparation of fluoropolymers.\nIt was first reported as \"dicarbon tetrafluoride\" in 1890.\n\nProperties: Tetrafluoroethylene is a synthetic colorless, odorless gas that is insoluble in water. Like all unsaturated fluorocarbons, it is susceptible to nucleophilic attack. It is unstable towards decomposition to carbon and carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and prone to form explosive peroxides in contact with air.\n\nIndustrial use: Polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene produces polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymers such as Teflon and Fluon. PTFE is one of the two fluorocarbon resins composed wholly of fluorine and carbon. The other resin composed purely of carbon and fluorine is the copolymer of TFE with typically 6\u20139% hexafluoropropene (HFP), which is known as FEP (fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymer). TFE is also used in the preparation of numerous copolymers that also include hydrogen and/or oxygen, including both fluoroplastics and fluoroelastomers. Typical TFE-based fluoroplastics include ETFE, the alternating 1:1 copolymer with ethylene, and PFA, which is a random copolymer similar to FEP but with a minor amount of a perfluoroalkyl vinyl ether (PAVE) rather than HFP. DuPont uses primarily perfluoro(methylvinylether), whereas Daikin uses primarily perfluoro(propylvinylether) in manufacturing PFA. There are numerous other fluoropolymers that contain tetrafluoroethylene, but usually not at greater than 50% by weight.\n\nManufacture: TFE is manufactured from chloroform. Chloroform is fluorinated by reaction with hydrogen fluoride to produce chlorodifluoromethane (R-22). Pyrolysis of chlorodifluoromethane (at 550\u2013750 \u00b0C) yields TFE, with difluorocarbene as an intermediate.\n\nCHCl3 + 2 HF \u2192 CHClF2 + 2 HCl\n2 CHClF2 \u2192 C2F4 + 2 HCl\nAlternatively, it can be prepared by pyrolysis of fluoroform (which is also produced from chloroform and HF):\n\n2 CHF3 \u2192 C2F4 + 2 HF\n\nLaboratory methods: A convenient, safe method for generating TFE is the pyrolysis of the sodium salt of pentafluoropropionic acid:\n\nC2F5CO2Na  \u2192   C2F4  +  CO2  +  NaF\nThe depolymerization reaction \u2013 vacuum pyrolysis of PTFE at 650\u2013700 \u00b0C (1,200\u20131,290 \u00b0F) in a quartz vessel \u2013 is a traditional laboratory synthesis of TFE. The  process is however challenging because attention must be paid to pressure, as well as the avoidance of perfluoroisobutylene. PTFE polymer cracks, and at a pressure below 5 Torr (670 Pa) exclusively C2F4 is obtained. At higher pressures the product mixture contains hexafluoropropylene and octafluorocyclobutane.\n\nReactions: Tetrafluoroethylene is a reactive molecule that participates in myriad reactions.  Owing to the presence of four fluorine substituents, its reactions differ strongly from the behavior of conventional alkenes such as ethylene.  Tetrafluoroethylene dimerizes, giving octafluorocyclobutane. Even normal alkenes and dienes add tetrafluoroethylene in a [2+2] manner.  1,3-Butadiene gives 3-vinyl-1,1,2,2-tetrafluorocyclobutane.\n\nSafety: The main hazard associated with TFE is that of explosion, especially if oxygen is present. TFE reacts with oxygen at low temperatures to form an explosive oxide, the detonation of which is usually sufficient to trigger explosive decomposition of TFE to C and CF4. Explosions can also be caused by adiabatic compression if the TFE is handled under high pressure, which it typically is in an industrial setting. If pressurised TFE is allowed into a vessel or pipework at a lower pressure, then the atmosphere in the vessel will be compressed by the TFE, causing it to heat up, potentially to the point where it might detonate the TFE. This has been known to cause explosions. In industry, pipework is flushed with pressurized nitrogen, before the introduction of TFE, both to exclude oxygen and prevent adiabatic compression.\nTFE is an alkylating agent, albeit a weak one, and as such is expected to be a carcinogen. LD50(rat, inhalation) = 40000 ppm.\nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies TFE as probably carcinogenic to humans based on animal studies.\n\nSee also: Tetrachloroethylene\n1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane\nFluorochemical industry\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: National Toxicology Program Chemical Repository\nTetrafluoroethylene, hexafluoropropylene and vinylidene fluoride terpolymer \u2013 aka THV, melt-processable members of the fluorocarbon family\nSleeuwenhoek, Anne; Cherrie, John (2012). \"Exposure assessment of tetrafluoroethylene and ammonium perfluorooctanoate 1951\u20132002\".

        "text1": "Title: Psoralen\nwikipedia: Psoralen (also called psoralene) is the parent compound in a family of naturally occurring organic compounds known as the linear furanocoumarins. It is structurally related to coumarin by the addition of a fused furan ring, and may be considered as a derivative of umbelliferone. Psoralen occurs naturally in the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, as well as in the common fig, celery, parsley, West Indian satinwood, and in all citrus fruits. It is widely used in PUVA (psoralen + UVA) treatment for psoriasis, eczema,  vitiligo, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; these applications are typically through the use of medications such as Methoxsalen.  Many furanocoumarins are extremely toxic to fish, and some are deposited in streams in Indonesia to catch fish.\n\nUses: Psoralen is a mutagen, and is used for this purpose in molecular biology research. Psoralen intercalates into DNA and on exposure to ultraviolet (UVA) radiation can form monoadducts and covalent interstrand cross-links (ICL) with thymines, preferentially at 5'-TpA sites in the genome, inducing apoptosis. Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) therapy can be used to treat hyperproliferative skin disorders like psoriasis and certain kinds of skin cancer. Unfortunately, PUVA treatment itself leads to a higher risk of skin cancer.\nAn important use of psoralen is in PUVA treatment for skin problems such as psoriasis and, to a lesser extent, eczema and vitiligo. This takes advantage of the high UV absorbance of psoralen. The psoralen is applied first to sensitise the skin, then UVA light is applied to address the condition. Psoralens are also used in photopheresis, where they are mixed with the extracted leukocytes before UV radiation is applied.\nDespite the photocarcinogenic properties of psoralen, it was used as a tanning activator in sunscreens until 1996. Psoralens are used in tanning accelerators, because psoralen increases the skin's sensitivity to light.  Some patients have had severe skin loss after sunbathing with psoralen-containing tanning activators. Patients with lighter skin colour suffer four times as much from the melanoma-generating properties of psoralens than those with darker skin. Psoralens short term side effects include nausea, vomiting, erythrema, pruritus, xerosis, skin pain due to phototoxic damage of dermal nerve and may cause cutaneous and genital skin malignancies.\nAn additional use for optimized psoralens is for the inactivation of pathogens in blood products. The synthetic amino-psoralen, amotosalen HCl, has been developed for the inactivation of infectious pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa) in platelet and plasma blood components prepared for transfusion support of patients. Prior to clinical use, amotosalen-treated platelets have been tested and found to be non-carcinogenic when using the established p53 knockout mouse model.  The technology is currently in routine use in certain European blood centers and has been recently approved in the US.\n\nChemistry: Psoralen intercalates into the DNA double helix where it is ideally positioned to form one or more adducts with adjacent pyrimidine bases, preferentially thymine, upon excitation by an ultraviolet photon.\nSeveral physicochemical methods have been employed to derive binding constants for psoralen-DNA interactions. Classically, two chambers of psoralen and buffered DNA solution are partitioned by a semi-permeable membrane; the affinity of the psoralen for DNA is directly related to the concentration of the psoralen in the DNA chamber after equilibrium. Water solubility is important for two reasons: pharmacokinetics relating to drug solubility in blood and necessitating the use of organic solvents (e.g. DMSO). Psoralens can also be activated by irradiation with long wavelength UV light. While UVA range light is the clinical standard, research that UVB is more efficient at forming photoadducts suggests that its use may lead to higher efficacy and lower treatment times.\nThe photochemically reactive sites in psoralens are the alkene-like carbon-carbon double bonds in the furan ring (the five-member ring) and the pyrone ring (the six-member ring). When appropriately intercalated adjacent to a pyrimidine base, a four-center photocycloaddition reaction can lead to the formation of either of two cyclobutyl-type monoadducts. Ordinarily, furan-side monoadducts form in a higher proportion. The furan monoadduct can absorb a second UVA photon leading to a second four-center photocycloaddition at the pyrone end of the molecule and hence the formation of a diadduct or cross-link. Pyrone monoadducts do not absorb in the UVA range and hence cannot form cross-links with further UVA irradiation.\nAnother important feature of this class of compounds is their ability to generate singlet oxygen, although this process is in direct competition with adduct formation and may be an alternate pathway for the dissipation of excited state energy.\nResearch on psoralen has historically focused on interactions with DNA and RNA (in particular, ICL formation). Psoralen, however, has also been shown to block signaling of the ErbB2 receptor which is overexpressed in certain aggressive types of breast cancer. A synthetic derivative of bergapten, 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen, shows promise as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting a specific potassium channel. Its structure prevents intercalation into DNA, and it only very weakly produces singlet oxygen, majorly reducing unwanted toxicity and mutagenicity in vivo. This has implications for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis). While cell-surface modification and ion channel blocking are two newly discovered mechanisms of action, much research remains to be done.\n\nStructure: Most furanocoumarins can be regarded as derivatives of either psoralen or angelicin. Psoralen and its derivatives are often referred to as the linear furanocoumarins, so called since they exhibit a linear chemical structure. Important linear furanocoumarins include xanthotoxin (also called methoxsalen), bergapten, imperatorin, and nodakenetin.\n\nThe structure of psoralen was originally deduced by identifying the products of its degradation reactions. It exhibits the normal reactions of the lactone of coumarin, such as ring opening by alkali to give a coumarinic acid or coumaric acid derivative. Potassium permanganate causes oxidation of the furan ring, while other methods of oxidation produce furan-2,3-carboxylic acid.\n\nSynthesis: Psoralen is difficult to synthesize because umbelliferone undergoes substitution at the 8-position rather than at the desired 6 position. Benzofuran reacts preferentially in the furan ring rather than in the benzene ring. However, the 7-hydroxy derivative of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (also called coumaran) does undergo substitution at the desired 6-position allowing the following synthesis of the coumarin system via a Gattermann\u2013Koch reaction followed by a Perkin condensation using acetic anhydride. The synthesis is then completed by dehydrogenation of the five-membered ring to produce the furan ring.\n\nBiosynthesis: Psoralen originates from coumarins in the shikimate pathway; its biosynthesis is shown in the figure below. The aromatic ring in 6 is activated at positions ortho to the hydroxyl group, and is alkylated by 5, an alkylating agent. The dimethylallyl group in 7 then undergoes cyclization with the phenol group to give 8. This transformation is catalysed by a cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase17 (psoralen 5-monooxygenase), and cofactors (NADPH) and molecular oxygen.\nA biosynthetic pathway in which psoralen is formed is shown in the figure below. A second P-450-dependent monooxygenase enzyme (psoralen synthase) then cleaves off 10 (in the form of 11) from 8 to give 1. This pathway does not involve any hydroxylated intermediate, and cleavage is postulated to be initiated by a radical reaction.\n\nPlant sources: Ficus carica (fig) is probably the most abundant source of psoralens. They are also found in small quantities in  Ammi visnaga (bisnaga), Pastinaca sativa (parsnip), Petroselinum crispum (parsley), Levisticum officinale (lovage), Foeniculum vulgare (fruit, i.e., fennel seeds), Daucus carota (carrot), Psoralea corylifolia (babchi), Apium graveolens (celery), bergamot oil (bergapten, bergamottin).\n\nRepair of psoralen DNA adducts: PUVA treatment produces both DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and monoadducts. The ICLs introduced by psoralen are highly genotoxic to actively replicating cells.  The covalent linkage impedes replication fork progression. Thus unlinking the ICL is required before replication can resume.  The initial steps in repair ordinarily involve incisions in one parental strand on both sides of the crosslink.  Subsequently, repair of the lesion can occur by an accurate or an inaccurate process.\nThe accurate process for repairing crosslinks is homologous recombinational repair (HRR). This involves replacing the damaged information using the intact information from another homologous chromosome in the same cell.  Escherichia coli cells deficient in HRR are highly sensitive to PUVA compared to wild-type cells.  HRR appears to be efficient.  In E. coli, even though one or two unrepaired crosslinks are sufficient to inactivate a cell, a wild-type cell can repair and therefore recover from 53 to 71 psoralen crosslinks.  In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae HRR is a major pathway for accurately removing psoralen-crosslinks.  In wild-type yeast, the recombination events associated with crosslink removal by HRR are predominantly non-crossover gene conversion events.  Psoralen crosslinks in virus DNA also appear to be removed by a recombinational repair process as occurs in SV40 virus infected cells, and in herpes simplex virus infected cells.\nOne inaccurate process for repairing psoralen crosslinks appears to employ a DNA polymerase to fill in the gap formed in the strand with the two incisions.  This process is inaccurate because the complementary un-incised strand still retains a portion of the crosslink and thus cannot serve as an adequate template for accurate repair synthesis.  Inaccurate repair synthesis can cause mutation.  Psoralen monoadducts in the template DNA strand may also cause inaccurate replication bypass (translesion synthesis) that can lead to mutation.  In phage T4, the increase in mutation observed after PUVA treatment was found to reflect translesion synthesis by wild-type DNA polymerase, likely due to imperfect proof reading capability.\n\nAnalysis of nucleic acids structures: Psoralens can reversibly crosslink nucleic acids double helices, and therefore have been used extensively for the analysis of interactions and structures for both DNA and RNA.\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: Dean, F.M.

In 1834, Kalbrunner isolated 5-methoxypsoralen from bergamot essential oil, hence the common name \"bergapten\". It was the first furanocoumarin to be isolated and identified.\n\nToxicity: Bergapten is a derivative of psoralen, the parent compound of a family of naturally-occurring organic compounds known as the linear furanocoumarins (so called since they exhibit a linear chemical structure). Some of the linear furanocoumarins, including bergapten, act as strong photosensitizers when applied topically to the skin.\nBergapten is often found in plants associated with phytophotodermatitis, a potentially serious skin inflammation. Contact with plant parts containing bergapten (and other linear furanocoumarins) followed by exposure to ultraviolet light may lead to phytophotodermatitis. In particular, bergapten appears to be the primary phototoxic compound responsible for Citrus-induced phytophotodermatitis.\nBergapten and other linear furanocoumarins induce a loss of template activity for RNA synthesis. 5-methoxypsoralen has also been noted for its mutagenic effects as well as its capacity for being a very potent agent for inducing chromosome aberrations. With a high enough concentration, complete mitotic inhibition was observed.\nThere is sufficient evidence that bergapten promotes cancer in animals but such evidence of carcinogenicity in humans is lacking. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, bergapten is probably carcinogenic to humans.\n\nMedical usages: Bergapten serves to have the skin absorb more light, and pigmentary diseases like vitiligo (leukodermia) and psoriasis have treatments involving furanocoumarins often in conjunction with sun exposure or solar radiation. In people who easily sunburn, furanocoumarins can also increase the tolerance of skin to solar radiation. Bergapten was shown to elicit certain skin reactions in order to even out pigmentation lightening for vitiligo patients depending on various factors like the susceptibility of the subject, the dosage, and the humidity, but the effects may be inconsistent.\nWith psoriasis, bergapten has been valued as an oral photochemotherapy treatment for its efficacy and lack of phototoxic and drug-insensitive reactions. It operates as a photosensitizing drug that is as effective or, with high enough dosage, more effective than 8-methoxypsoralen in the clearance of psoriasis lesions. It has been shown to be a valuable alternative to 8-methoxypsoralen due to the relative lack of side effects during treatment like erythma, pruritus, and nausea.\nBergapten has also been implicated as a potential prevention method for sunlight-related skin cancer. One study found that a tan gained with bergapten had less DNA damage in human subjects. Bergapten has been shown to have anti-tumoral effects, like its ability to induce the autophagic process in breast cancer cells. One study suggested that this was possible through the up-regulation of PTEN gene expression in those breast cancer cells.\nBergapten, alongside other furanocoumarins, has also been implicated in Cytochrome P450 inhibition.\n\nSynthesis: \nBergapten is a natural compound coming from plants like the common fig, but it can also be synthesized. Most syntheses of linear furanocoumarins involve starting with a central aromatic unit and adding two heterocyclic rings. Alternate routes of synthesis are desirable to avoid regiochemical problems and moderate yields. The synthesis described here involves Iodine as a removable group to insure regiochemical integrity and convergence. As shown in the diagram, phloroglucinol (compound 1) was the starting material. Mono-methylation was conducted followed by a reaction with ethyl propiolate in the presence of  ZnCl2 to yield 7-hydroxy-5-methoxycoumarin (product 3, not shown) with 68% yield. The 8-position of 7-hydroxy-5-methoxycoumarin was then protected by iodine to avoid the formation of an angular furanocoumarin. Product 4 in the diagram is the result of that iodine protection. Product 5 was the result of the allylation of product 4. Osmium tetraoxide and sodium metaperiodate were used to oxidatively cleave the O-allyl derivative onto the aldehyde product 7 via a diol intermediate (product 6, not shown). Cyclization of the aldehyde product 7 using BF3-Et2O in tetra-n-butylammonium bromide was then conducted to construct the furan ring. The final step was to remove the iodine protective group via Pd(OAc)2 to ultimately produce bergapten (product 9) with 90% yield. Synthetic bergapten was isolated as a colorless compound with properties spectroscopically identical to the natural product.\nA known use of bergapten is in the synthesis of Fraxinol. The key reaction in this synthesis is the oxidation of the furan ring of visnagin and bergapten with chromic acid.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n pubchem:\n5-Methoxypsoralen with ultraviolet A therapy can cause cancer according to an independent committee of scientific and health experts.\nGrayish-white microcrystalline powder or yellow fluffy solid.

        "text1": "Title: Ethosuximide\nwikipedia: Ethosuximide, sold under the brand name Zarontin among others, is a medication used to treat absence seizures. It may be used by itself or with other antiseizure medications such as valproic acid. Ethosuximide is taken by mouth.\nEthosuximide is usually well tolerated. Common side effects include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, low blood cell levels, and lupus erythematosus. It is unclear if it has adverse effects on the fetus during pregnancy. Ethosuximide is in the succinimide family of medications. Its mechanism of action is thought to be due to antagonism of the postsynaptic T-type voltage-gated calcium channel.\nEthosuximide was approved for medical use in the United States in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Ethosuximide is available as a generic medication. As of 2019, its availability was limited in many countries, with concerns about price fixing in the United States.\n\nMedical uses: Ethosuximide is approved for absence seizures, and is considered the first choice medication for treating them, in part because it lacks the idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity of the alternative anti-absence drug, valproic acid.\n\nAdverse effects: As with other anticonvulsants, ethosuximide carries a warning about use during pregnancy. Although a causal relationship with birth defects has not be established, the potential for harm to the baby is weighed against the known harm caused by a mother having even minor seizures.\n\nCentral nervous system: \n\nCommon: drowsiness\nmental confusion\ninsomnia\nheadache\nataxia\n\nRare: paranoid psychosis\nincreased libido\nexacerbation of depression\n\nGastrointestinal: dyspepsia\nvomiting\nnausea\ncramps\nconstipation\ndiarrhea\nstomach pain\nloss of appetite\nweight loss\ngum enlargement\nswelling of tongue\nabnormal liver function\n\nGenitourinary: microscopic hematuria\nvaginal bleeding\n\nBlood: The following can occur with or without bone marrow loss:\n\npancytopenia\nagranulocytosis\nleukopenia\neosinophilia\n\nSkin: urticaria\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nStevens\u2013Johnson syndrome\nhirsutism\npruritic erythematous rashes\n\nEyes: myopia\n\nDrug interactions: Valproates can either decrease or increase the levels of ethosuximide; however, combinations of valproates and ethosuximide had a greater protective index than either drug alone.\nIt may elevate serum phenytoin levels.\n\nMechanism of action: The mechanism by which ethosuximide affects neuronal excitability includes block of T-type calcium channels, and may include effects of the drug on other classes of ion channel. The primary finding that ethosuximide is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that ethosuximide blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms. Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels may have contributed to reports of ethosuximide ineffectiveness.\nIn March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince showed that ethosuximide and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June of that same year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that. The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 \u03bcmol/L to 1 mmol/L.\nThat same year, however, Herrington and Lingle found no such effect at concentrations of up to 2.5 mmol/L. The year after, a study conducted on human neocortical cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, the first to use human tissue, found that ethosuximide had no effect on Ca2+ currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect.\nIn 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University reported a 100% block of T-type current in dorsal root ganglia at 23.7 \u00b1 0.5 mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported. That same year, Leresche et al. reported that ethosuximide had no effect on T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating Na+ current by 60% and the Ca2+-activated K+ currents by 39.1 \u00b1 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na+ current is responsible for the anti-absence properties.\nIn the introduction of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels. Using cloned \u03b11G, \u03b11H, and \u03b11I T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an IC50 of 12 \u00b1 2 mmol/L and that of N-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of mesuximide) is 1.95 \u00b1 0.19 mmol/L for \u03b11G, 1.82 \u00b1 0.16 mmol/L for \u03b11I, and 3.0 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/L for \u03b11H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.\n\nStereochemistry: Ethosuximide is a chiral drug with a stereocenter. Therapeutically, the racemate, the 1: 1 mixture of ( S ) and ( R ) - isomers used.\n\nSociety and culture: \n\nCost: As of 2019 there were concerns in the United States that the price of ethosuximide was inflated by manufacturers.\n\nAvailability: Availability of ethosuximide is limited in many countries. It was marketed under the trade names Emeside and Zarontin. However, both capsule preparations were discontinued from production, leaving only generic preparations available. Emeside capsules were discontinued by their manufacturer, Laboratories for Applied Biology, in 2005. Similarly, Zarontin capsules were discontinued by Pfizer in 2007.

It is a colorless, flammable gas or refrigerated liquid with a faintly sweet odor.\nEthyl chloride was first synthesized by Basil Valentine by reacting ethanol and hydrochloric acid in 1440. Glauber made it in 1648 by reacting ethanol and zinc chloride.\n\nProduction: Chloroethane is produced by hydrochlorination of ethylene:\n\nC2H4 + HCl \u2192 C2H5Cl\nAt various times in the past, chloroethane has also been produced from ethanol and hydrochloric acid, from ethane and chlorine, or from ethanol and phosphorus trichloride, but these routes are no longer economical. Some chloroethane is generated as a byproduct of polyvinyl chloride production.\n\nUses: Chloroethane is an inexpensive ethylating agent. It reacts with aluminium metal to give ethylaluminium sesquichloride, a precursor to polymers and other useful organoaluminium compounds. Chloroethane is used to convert cellulose to ethylcellulose, a thickening agent and binder in paints, cosmetics, and similar products.\nLike other chlorinated hydrocarbons, chloroethane has been used as a refrigerant, an aerosol spray propellant, an anesthetic, and a blowing agent for foam packaging. For a time it was used as a promoter chemical in the aluminium chloride catalyzed process to produce ethylbenzene, the precursor for styrene monomer. At present though, it is not widely used in any of these roles.\n\nObsolete uses: Beginning in 1922 and continuing through most of the 20th century, the major use of chloroethane was to produce tetraethyllead (TEL), an anti-knock additive for gasoline. TEL has been or is being phased out in most of the industrialized world, and the demand for chloroethane has fallen sharply.\n\nNiche uses: Chloroethane has a low boiling point, so when applied topically, the heat absorbed by the boiling liquid produces a deep and rapid chill. When sprayed on the skin, this chill has a mild anesthetic effect, which can be useful when removing splinters or incising abscesses in a clinical setting. Chloroethane was standard equipment in casualty wards. It was commonly used to induce general anaesthesia before continuing with di-ethyl ether, which has a much slower uptake. In dentistry, chloroethane is used as one of the means of diagnosing a 'dead tooth', i.e., one in which the pulp has died. A small amount of the substance is placed on the suspect tooth using a cotton wad; if the tooth is still alive this should be sensed by the patient as mild discomfort that subsides when the wad is removed.\n\nRecreational drug: Chloroethane is a recreational inhalant drug, although it should not be confused with a duster or canned air, which is composed of fluorinated low-weight hydrocarbons such as tetrafluoromethane, chlorodifluoromethane or another similar gas.\nIn Brazil, it is a major component of a traditional (though illegal) drug taken during Carnaval, known locally as \"lan\u00e7a-perfume\" (lit. perfume launcher or sprayer).\n\nSafety: The vapor is flammable and narcotic, which requires care.\nMonochloroethane is the least toxic of the chloroethanes. Like other chlorinated hydrocarbons, it is a central nervous system depressant, albeit a less potent one than many similar compounds. People breathing its vapors at less than 1% concentration in air usually experience no symptoms. At concentrations of 3% to 5%, victims usually exhibit symptoms similar to those of alcohol intoxication. Breathing its vapors at >15% concentration is often fatal; most commercially available handheld containers contain 30% per volume of concentrated vapors that naturally disperse in the outside air.\nIf exposed to concentrations higher than 6% to 8% victims often exhibit shallow breathing, loss of consciousnesses, and depressed heart-rate. They can be roused with physical contact or loud noise. At this point removal from the area of exposure is advised to restore consciousness. The long-term effects of exposure over a period of 4 or more hours will cause side effects similar to alcoholic hang-over with dehydration, dizziness, loss of clear vision and temporary loss of consciousness, which can last an hour or more. If no longer exposed to the gas, a victim will return to normal health quickly. This can be helped with intake of extra fluids, vitamins, and sugars.\nToxic over-exposure starts at 9% to 12% concentrations, the heart rate drops further, the victim may have more shallow breathing or stop all together, they do not respond to any outside stimulation and may begin to involuntarily gasp, belch or vomit, which can lead to aspiration if the victim is not turned on their side. This constitutes a medical emergency and requires prompt action. It is advised to move the victim to clear air and administer forced breathing for them to purge the lungs of the toxic fumes. If the victim recovers quickly enough, hospitalization may not be required, but will require a medical examination to ensure that no organ damage has occurred.\nAt >12% concentration, the victim's heart, lungs and kidneys begin to fail. Immediate CPR followed by medical support measures may be required to prevent fatal kidney, lung and heart failure. Singer Darius Campbell Danesh died of \"toxic effects of chloroethane\" as well as suffocation.\nStudies on the effects of chronic ethyl chloride exposure in animals have given inconsistent results, and no data exists for its long-term effects on humans.\nWhile chloroethane is not classified as carcinogenic to humans specifically, it is still used in medicine as a local anesthetic.\n\nReferences: \n\nExternal links: \nInternational Chemical Safety Card 0132\nNIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards. \"#0267\".

It was formerly used in the production of tetraethyllead. It has a role as a local anaesthetic, an antipruritic drug and an inhalation anaesthetic.\nEthyl chloride, or chloroethane, has a chemical formula C2H5Cl. It was commonly used in the production of tetraethyllead (TEL), which is an additive for gasoline. It was also used in other commerical applications as a chemical reagent. It is still used in the treatment of cellulose to make ethylcellulose for commercial products. Ethyl chloride is used as a diagnostic tool to detect a dead tooth with nonviable pulp.\nExposure to ethyl chloride may occur from the use of consumer products containing it. The acute (short- term) effects of ethyl chloride from inhalation exposure in humans consists of temporary feelings of drunkenness, and higher levels cause lack of muscle coordination and unconsciousness. The chronic (long-term) health effects resulting from exposure to air containing low levels of ethyl chloride in humans is not known. Some animal studies indicate effects on the lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart due to exposure to ethyl chloride via inhalation. No studies were located regarding carcinogenic effects following ethyl chloride inhalation exposure in humans.

It can be smelled in water at levels above 0.02 parts chloroethane in a million parts of water (ppm). In pressurized containers, chloroethane exists as a liquid. However, the liquid evaporates quickly when exposed to air. It catches fire easily and is very dangerous when exposed to heat or flame. Chloroethane does not occur naturally in the environment. It is present in the environment as a result of human activity. In the past, the largest single use for chloroethane was for the production of tetraethyl lead, which is a gasoline additive. However, production of chloroethane has decreased dramatically as a result of stricter government regulations controlling lead in gasoline.

        "text2": "Title: Tetraethyllead\nwikipedia: Tetraethyllead (commonly styled tetraethyl lead), abbreviated TEL, is an organolead compound with the formula Pb(C2H5)4. It was widely used as a fuel additive for much of the 20th century, first being mixed with gasoline beginning in the 1920s. This \"leaded gasoline\" had an increased octane rating that allowed engine compression to be raised substantially and in turn increased vehicle performance and fuel economy. TEL was first synthesised by German chemist Carl Jacob L\u00f6wig in 1853. American chemical engineer Thomas Midgley Jr., who was working for the U.S. corporation General Motors, was the first to discover its effectiveness as an antiknock agent in 1921, after spending several years attempting to find an additive that was both highly effective and inexpensive.\nIn the mid-20th century, scientists discovered TEL caused lead poisoning and was toxic to the human brain, especially in children. The United States and many other countries began phasing out the use of TEL in automotive fuel in the 1970s. By the early 2000s, most countries had completely banned the use of TEL in gasoline. Since 2011, leaded gasoline has been banned in every country. A 2011 study backed by the United Nations estimated that the removal of TEL had resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, and 1.2 million fewer premature deaths.\nDespite being banned from use in automotive fuel, TEL is sometimes still used in certain grades of aviation fuel. Innospec has claimed to be the last firm legally making TEL but, as of 2013, TEL was being produced illegally by several companies in China. In July 2021, the sale of leaded gasoline for cars was completely phased out worldwide, prompting the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to declare an \"official end\" of its use in cars on August 30, 2021.\n\nSynthesis and properties: TEL is produced by reacting chloroethane with a sodium\u2013lead alloy.\n\nThe product is recovered by steam distillation, leaving a sludge of lead and sodium chloride. TEL is a viscous colorless liquid with a sweet odor. Because TEL is charge neutral and contains an exterior of alkyl groups, it is highly lipophilic and soluble in petrol (gasoline). This property, which allows it to dissolve so evenly and effectively in motor fuel, also allows it to dissolve oils and fats well, and therefore, diffuse through the blood\u2013brain barrier and accumulate within the limbic forebrain, frontal cortex, and hippocampus.\nDespite decades of research, no reactions were found to improve upon this process, which is rather difficult, involves metallic sodium, and converts only 25% of the lead to TEL. A related compound, tetramethyllead, was commercially produced by a different electrolytic reaction. A process with lithium was developed but never put into practice.\n\nReactions: A noteworthy feature of TEL is the weakness of its four C\u2013Pb bonds. At the temperatures found in internal combustion engines, TEL decomposes completely into lead as well as combustible, short-lived ethyl radicals. Lead and lead oxide scavenge radical intermediates in combustion reactions. Engine knock is caused by a cool flame, an oscillating low-temperature combustion reaction that occurs before the proper, hot ignition. Lead quenches the pyrolysed radicals and thus kills the radical chain reaction that would sustain a cool flame, preventing it from disturbing the smooth ignition of the hot flame front. Lead itself is the reactive antiknock agent, and the ethyl groups serve as a gasoline-soluble carrier.\nWhen TEL burns, it produces not only carbon dioxide and water, but also lead and lead(II) oxide:\n\nPb and PbO would quickly over-accumulate and foul an engine. For this reason, 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane were also added to gasoline as lead scavengers\u2014these agents form volatile lead(II) chloride and lead(II) bromide, respectively, which flush the lead from the engine and into the air:\n\nIn motor fuel: TEL was extensively used as a gasoline additive beginning in the 1920s, wherein it served as an effective antiknock agent and reduced exhaust valve and valve seat wear. Concerns were raised in reputable journals of likely health outcomes of fine particles of lead in the atmosphere as early as 1924.\n\nValve wear preventive: Tetraethyllead helps cool intake valves and is an excellent buffer against microwelds forming between exhaust valves and their seats. Once these valves reopen, the microwelds pull apart and abrade the valves and seats, leading to valve recession. When TEL began to be phased out, the automotive industry began specifying hardened valve seats and upgraded materials which allow for high wear resistance without requiring lead.\n\nAntiknock agent: A gasoline-fuelled reciprocating engine requires fuel of sufficient octane rating to prevent uncontrolled combustion (preignition and detonation). Antiknock agents allow the use of higher compression ratios for greater efficiency and peak power. Adding varying amounts of additives to gasoline allowed easy, inexpensive control of octane ratings. TEL offered the business advantage of being commercially profitable because its use for this purpose could be patented. Aviation fuels with TEL used in WWII reached octane ratings of 150 to enable turbocharged and supercharged engines such as the Rolls-Royce Merlin and Griffon to reach high horsepower ratings at altitude. In military aviation, TEL manipulation allowed a range of different fuels to be tailored for particular flight conditions.\nIn 1935 a licence to produce TEL was given to IG Farben, enabling the newly formed German Luftwaffe to use high-octane gasoline. A company, Ethyl GmbH, was formed that produced TEL at two sites in Germany with a government contract from 10 June 1936.\nIn 1938 the United Kingdom Air Ministry contracted with ICI for the construction and operation of a TEL plant. A site was chosen at Holford Moss, near Plumley in Cheshire. Construction started in April 1939 and TEL was being produced by September 1940.\n\n\"Ethyl Fluid\": For mixing with raw gasoline, TEL was most commonly supplied in the form of \"Ethyl Fluid\", which consisted of TEL blended with 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane. Ethyl Fluid also contained a reddish dye to distinguish treated from untreated gasoline and discourage the use of leaded gasoline for other purposes such as cleaning.\nIn the 1920s before safety procedures were strengthened, 17 workers for the Ethyl Corporation, DuPont, and Standard Oil died from the effects of exposure to lead.\nEthyl Fluid's formulation consisted of:\n\n61.45% tetraethyllead\n18.80% 1,2-dichloroethane\n17.85% 1,2-dibromoethane\n1.90% inerts and dyes\nDichloroethane and dibromoethane act in a synergistic manner, where equal or approximately equal quantities of both provide the best scavenging ability.\n\nPhaseout and ban: In most industrialized countries, a phaseout of TEL from road vehicle fuels was completed by the early 2000s because of concerns over air and soil lead levels and the accumulative neurotoxicity of lead. In the European Union, tetraethyllead has been classified as a Substance of Very High Concern and placed on the Candidate List for Authorisation under Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Potential use of TEL would need to be authorised through the REACH authorisation procedure. While not a complete ban, it introduces significant obligations such as a mandatory analysis of alternatives and socioeconomic analysis.\nThe use of catalytic converters, mandated in the United States for 1975 and later model-year cars to meet tighter emissions regulations, started a gradual phase-out of leaded gasoline in the U.S. The need for TEL was lessened by several advances in automotive engineering and petroleum chemistry. Safer methods for making higher-octane blending stocks such as reformate and iso-octane reduced the need to rely on TEL, as did other antiknock additives of varying toxicity including metallic compounds such as methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) as well as oxygenates including methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE).\nThe first country to completely ban leaded gasoline was Japan in 1986.\nSince January 1993 all gasoline powered cars sold in the European Union and the United Kingdom have been required to use unleaded fuel. This was to comply with the Euro 1 emission standards which mandated that all new cars to be fitted with a catalytic converter. Unleaded fuel was first introduced in the United Kingdom in June 1986.\nLeaded gasoline was removed from the forecourts in the United Kingdom on January 1, 2000, and a Lead Replacement Petrol was introduced although this was largely withdrawn by 2003 due to dwindling sales. An exemption to the ban exists for owners of classic cars.\nVehicles designed and built to run on leaded fuel often require modification to run on unleaded gasoline. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed to compensate for the relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of hardened exhaust valves and seats. Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder head gaskets and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons, although modern high-octane unleaded gasoline has eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.\nLeaded gasoline remained legal as of late 2014 in parts of Algeria, Iraq, Yemen, Myanmar, North Korea, and Afghanistan. North Korea and Myanmar purchased their TEL from China, while Algeria, Iraq, and Yemen purchased it from the specialty chemical company Innospec, the world's sole remaining legal manufacturer of TEL. In 2011 several Innospec executives were charged and imprisoned for bribing various government state-owned oil companies to approve the sale of their TEL products.\nAs of June 2016 the UNEP-sponsored phase-out was nearly complete: only Algeria, Iraq, and Yemen continued widespread use of leaded gasoline, although not exclusively. In July 2021, Algeria had halted its sale.\n\nLeaded-fuel bans: Leaded-fuel bans for road vehicles came into effect as follows:\n\nAfrica: Egypt: 1999\nSouth Africa: 2006\nLeaded petrol was supposed to be completely phased out continent-wide on 1 January 2006, following a ban initiated from the 2002 Earth Summit. However, in Algeria refineries needed to be altered; as a result, leaded fuel remained available in parts of Algeria, with phaseout scheduled for 2016. After the Algerian Government outlawed the sale of leaded petrol throughout all of Algeria, leaded petrol has now been effectively phased out.\n\nIn motor racing: Leaded fuel was commonly used in professional motor racing, until its phase out beginning in the 1990s. Since 1992, Formula One racing cars have been required to use fuel containing no more than 5 mg/L of lead.\nNASCAR began experimentation in 1998 with an unleaded fuel, and in 2006 began switching the national series to unleaded fuel, completing the transition at the Fontana round in February 2007 when the premier class switched. This was influenced after blood tests of NASCAR teams revealed elevated blood lead levels.\n\nAviation gasoline: TEL remains an ingredient of 100 octane avgas for piston-engine aircraft. The current formulation of 100LL (low lead, blue) aviation gasoline contains 2.12 grams per US gallon (0.56 g/L) of TEL, half the amount of the previous 100/130 (green) octane avgas (at 4.24 grams per gallon), and twice as much as the 1 gram per gallon permitted in regular automotive leaded gasoline prior to 1988 and substantially greater than the allowed 0.001 grams per gallon in automotive unleaded gasoline sold in the United States today. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, FAA, and others are working on economically feasible replacements for leaded avgas, which still releases 100 tons of lead every year.\n\nAlternative antiknock agents: Antiknock agents are classed as high-percentage additives, such as alcohol, and low-percentage additives based on heavy elements. Since the main problem with TEL is its lead content, many alternative additives that contain less poisonous metals have been examined. A manganese-carrying additive, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT or methylcymantrene), was used for a time as an antiknock agent, though its safety is controversial and it has been the subject of bans and lawsuits. Ferrocene, an organometallic compound of iron, is also used as an antiknock agent although with some significant drawbacks.\nHigh-percentage additives are organic compounds that do not contain metals, but require much higher blending ratios, such as 20\u201330% for benzene and ethanol. It had been established by 1921 that ethanol was an effective antiknock agent, but TEL was introduced instead mainly for commercial reasons. Oxygenates such as TAME derived from natural gas, MTBE made from methanol, and ethanol-derived ETBE, have largely supplanted TEL. MTBE has environmental risks of its own and there are also bans on its use.\nImprovements to gasoline itself decrease the need for antiknock additives. Synthetic iso-octane and alkylate are examples of such blending stocks. Benzene and other high-octane aromatics can be also blended to raise the octane number, but they are disfavored today because of toxicity and carcinogenicity.\n\nToxicity: 6 mL of tetraethyllead is enough to induce severe lead poisoning. The hazards of TEL content are heightened due to the compound's volatility and high lipophilicity, enabling it to easily cross the blood\u2013brain barrier.\nEarly symptoms of acute exposure to tetraethyllead can manifest as irritation of the eyes and skin, sneezing, fever, vomiting, and a metallic taste in the mouth. Later symptoms of acute TEL poisoning include pulmonary edema, anemia, ataxia, convulsions, severe weight loss, delirium, irritability, hallucinations, nightmares, fever, muscle and joint pain, swelling of the brain, coma, and damage to cardiovascular and renal organs.\nChronic exposure to TEL can cause long-term negative effects such as memory loss, delayed reflexes, neurological problems, insomnia, tremors, psychosis, loss of attention, and an overall decrease in IQ and cognitive function.\nThe carcinogenity of tetraethyllead is debatable. It is believed to harm the male reproductive system and cause birth defects.\nConcerns over the toxicity of lead eventually led to the ban on TEL in automobile gasoline in many countries. Some neurologists have speculated that the lead phaseout may have caused average IQ levels to rise by several points in the US (by reducing cumulative brain damage throughout the population, especially in the young). For the entire US population, during and after the TEL phaseout, the mean blood lead level dropped from 16 \u03bcg/dL in 1976 to only 3 \u03bcg/dL in 1991. The U.S. Centers of Disease control previously labelled children with 10 \u03bcg/dL or more as having a \"blood lead level of concern\". In 2021, the level was lowered in accordance with the average lead level in the U.S. decreasing to 3.5 \u03bcg/dL or more as having a \"blood lead level of concern\".\n\nHistory: In 1853, German chemist Karl Jacob L\u00f6wig (1803\u20131890) first prepared what he claimed was Pb2(C2H5)3 from ethyl iodide and an alloy of lead and sodium. In 1859, English chemist George Bowdler Buckton (1818\u20131905) reported what he claimed was Pb(C2H5)2 from zinc ethyl (Zn(C2H5)2) and lead(II) chloride. Later authors credit both methods of preparation with producing tetraethyl lead.\n\nIn fuel: TEL remained unimportant commercially until the 1920s. In 1921, at the direction of DuPont Corporation, which manufactured TEL, it was found to be an effective antiknock agent by Thomas Midgley, working under Charles Kettering at General Motors Corporation Research. General Motors patented the use of TEL as an antiknock agent and used the name \"Ethyl\" that had been proposed by Kettering in its marketing materials, thereby avoiding the negative connotation of the word \"lead\". Early research into \"engine knocking\" (also called \"pinging\" or \"pinking\") was also led by A.H. Gibson and Harry Ricardo in England and Thomas Boyd in the United States. The discovery that lead additives modified this behavior led to the widespread adoption of their use in the 1920s, and therefore more powerful, higher-compression engines. In 1924, Standard Oil of New Jersey (ESSO/EXXON) and General Motors created the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation to produce and market TEL. Deepwater, New Jersey, across the river from Wilmington, was the site for production of some of DuPont's most important chemicals, particularly TEL. After TEL production at the Bayway Refinery was shut down, Deepwater was the only plant in the Western hemisphere producing TEL up to 1948, when it accounted for the bulk of the Dupont/Deepwater's production.\n\nInitial controversy: The toxicity of concentrated TEL was recognized early on, as lead had been recognized since the 19th century as a dangerous substance that could cause lead poisoning. In 1924, a public controversy arose over the \"loony gas\", after five workers died, and many others were severely injured, in Standard Oil refineries in New Jersey. There had also been a private controversy for two years prior to this controversy; several public health experts, including Alice Hamilton and Yandell Henderson, engaged Midgley and Kettering with letters warning of the dangers to public health. After the death of the workers, dozens of newspapers reported on the issue. The New York Times editorialized in 1924 that the deaths should not interfere with the production of more powerful fuel.\nTo settle the issue, the U.S. Public Health Service conducted a conference in 1925, and the sales of TEL were voluntarily suspended for one year to conduct a hazard assessment. The conference was initially expected to last for several days, but reportedly the conference decided that evaluating presentations on alternative anti-knock agents was not \"its province\", so it lasted a single day. Kettering and Midgley stated that no alternatives for anti-knocking were available, although private memos showed discussion of such agents. One commonly discussed agent was ethanol. The Public Health Service created a committee that reviewed a government-sponsored study of workers and an Ethyl lab test, and concluded that while leaded gasoline should not be banned, it should continue to be investigated. The low concentrations present in gasoline and exhaust were not perceived as immediately dangerous. A U.S. Surgeon General committee issued a report in 1926 that concluded there was no real evidence that the sale of TEL was hazardous to human health but urged further study. In the years that followed, research was heavily funded by the lead industry; in 1943, Randolph Byers found children with lead poisoning had behavior problems, but the Lead Industries Association threatened him with a lawsuit and the research ended.\nIn the late 1920s, Robert A. Kehoe of the University of Cincinnati was the Ethyl Corporation's chief medical consultant and one of the lead industry's staunchest advocates, who would not be discredited until decades later by Dr. Clair Patterson's work on human lead burdens (see below) and other studies. In 1928, Dr. Kehoe expressed the opinion that there was no basis for concluding that leaded fuels posed any health threat. He convinced the Surgeon General that the dose\u2013response relationship of lead had \"no effect\" below a certain threshold. As the head of Kettering Laboratories for many years, Kehoe would become a chief promoter of the safety of TEL, an influence that did not begin to wane until about the early 1960s. But by the 1970s, the general opinion of the safety of TEL would change, and by 1976 the U.S. government would begin to require the phaseout of this product.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Clair Cameron Patterson accidentally discovered the pollution caused by TEL in the environment while determining the age of the Earth. As he attempted to measure lead content of very old rocks, and the time it took uranium to decay into lead, the readings were made inaccurate by lead in the environment that contaminated his samples. He was then forced to work in a cleanroom to keep his samples uncontaminated by environmental pollution of lead. After coming up with a fairly accurate estimate of the age of the Earth, he turned to investigating the lead contamination problem by examining ice cores from countries such as Greenland. He realized that the lead contamination in the environment dated from about the time that TEL became widely used as a fuel additive in gasoline. Being aware of the health dangers posed by lead and suspicious of the pollution caused by TEL, he became one of the earliest and most effective proponents of removing it from use.\nIn the 1960s, the first clinical works were published proving the toxicity of this compound in humans, e.g. by Miros\u0142aw Jan Stasik.\n\nModern findings: In the 1970s, Herbert Needleman found that higher lead levels in children were correlated with decreased school performance. Needleman was repeatedly accused of scientific misconduct by individuals within the lead industry, but he was eventually cleared by a scientific advisory council. Needleman also wrote the average US child's blood lead level was 13.7 \u03bcg/dL in 1976 and that Patterson believed that everyone was to some degree poisoned by TEL in gasoline.\nIn the U.S. in 1973, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline over a series of annual phases, which therefore came to be known as the \"lead phasedown\" program. EPA's rules were issued under section 211 of the Clean Air Act, as amended 1970. The Ethyl Corp challenged the EPA regulations in Federal court. Although the EPA's regulation was initially invalidated, the EPA won the case on appeal, so the TEL phasedown began to be implemented in 1976. Leaded gas was banned in vehicles with catalytic converters in 1975 due to damage of catalytic converters but it continued to be sold for vehicles without catalytic converters.  Additional regulatory changes were made by EPA over the next decade (including adoption of a trading market in \"lead credits\" in 1982 that became the precursor of the Acid Rain Allowance Market, adopted in 1990 for SO2), but the decisive rule was issued in 1985. The EPA mandated that lead additive be reduced by 91 percent by the end of 1986. A 1994 study had indicated that the concentration of lead in the blood of the U.S. population had dropped 78% from 1976 to 1991. The U.S. phasedown regulations also were due in great part to studies conducted by Philip J. Landrigan.\nIn Europe, Professor Derek Bryce-Smith was among the first to highlight the potential dangers of TEL and became a leading campaigner for removal of lead additives from petrol. \nFrom 1 January 1996, the U.S. Clean Air Act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on-road vehicles although that year the US EPA indicated that TEL could still be used in aircraft, racing cars, farm equipment, and marine engines. Thus, what had begun in the U.S. as a phasedown ultimately ended in a phase-out for on-road vehicle TEL. Similar bans in other countries have resulted in lowering levels of lead in people's bloodstreams.\nTaking cue from the domestic programs, the U.S. Agency for International Development undertook an initiative to reduce tetraethyl lead use in other countries, notably its efforts in Egypt begun in 1995. In 1996, with the cooperation of the U.S. AID, Egypt took almost all of the lead out of its gasoline. The success in Egypt provided a model for AID efforts worldwide.\nBy 2000, the TEL industry had moved the major portion of their sales to developing countries whose governments they lobbied against phasing out leaded gasoline. Leaded gasoline was withdrawn entirely from the European Union market on 1 January 2000, although it had been banned earlier in most member states. Other countries also phased out TEL. India banned leaded petrol in March 2000.\nBy 2011, the United Nations announced that it had been successful in phasing out leaded gasoline worldwide. \"Ridding the world of leaded petrol, with the United Nations leading the effort in developing countries, has resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, 1.2 million fewer premature deaths, higher overall intelligence and 58 million fewer crimes\", the United Nations Environmental Programme said. The announcement was slightly premature, as a few countries still had leaded gasoline for sale as of 2017.  On 30 August 2021 the United Nations Environment Programme announced that leaded gasoline had been eliminated.  The final stocks of the product were used up in Algeria, which had continued to produce leaded gasoline until July 2021.\n\nEffect on crime rates: Reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the United States. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve with a 22-year time lag. After the ban on TEL, blood lead levels in U.S. children dramatically decreased. Researchers including Amherst College economist Jessica Wolpaw Reyes, Department of Housing and Urban Development consultant Rick Nevin, and Howard Mielke of Tulane University say that declining exposure to lead is responsible for an up to 56% decline in crime from 1992 to 2002. Taking into consideration other factors that are believed to have increased crime rates over that period, Reyes found that the reduced exposure to lead led to an actual decline of 34% over that period.\n\nLingering issues over time: Although leaded gasoline has long since ended its history of regular use in U.S. transportation, it has left high concentrations of lead in the soil adjacent to roads that were heavily used prior to its phaseout. These contaminated materials present health dangers even when merely touched or when components of it get breathed in. Children, especially those in poverty inside of the U.S., are particularly at risk.\n\nSee also: Elmer Keiser Bolton\nLead abatement\nList of petrol additives\n\nReferences: \n\nFurther reading: \n\nExternal links: \n\nMedia articles: The Man Who Warned the World About Lead (PBS / NOVA)\nThe Most Important Scientist You\u2019ve Never Heard Of, BY Lucas Reilly, May 17, 2017, mentalfloss.com\nThe World Has Finally Stopped Using Leaded Gasoline.

        "text1": "Title: Xylazine\nwikipedia: Xylazine is a structural analog of clonidine and an \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, sold under many trade names worldwide, most notably the Bayer brand name Rompun, as well as Anased, Sedazine and Chanazine.\nXylazine is a common veterinary drug used for sedation, anesthesia, muscle relaxation, and analgesia in animals such as horses, cattle, and other mammals. In veterinary anesthesia, it is often used in combination with ketamine. Veterinarians also use xylazine as an emetic, especially in cats. Drug interactions vary with different animals.\nXylazine has become a commonly abused street drug in the United States where it is known by the street name \"tranq\", particularly in the territory of Puerto Rico. The drug is being diverted from stocks for equine veterinarians as well as trafficked in bulk from China to be used as a cutting agent for heroin and fentanyl, causing necrotic skin wounds leading to serious infections and limb amputations as well as other health issues. Fentanyl mixed with xylazine is known by the street names \"sleep-cut\", \"zombie drug\", \"Iso\" and \"tranq dope\".\n\nHistory: Xylazine was discovered as an antihypertensive agent in 1962 by Farbenfabriken Bayer in Leverkusen, Germany. Accounts of the actions and uses of xylazine in animals were reported as early as the late 1960s and early 1970s. Results from early human clinical studies confirmed that xylazine has several central nervous system depressant effects. Xylazine administration is used for sedation, anesthesia, muscle relaxation, and analgesia. It causes a significant reduction in blood pressure and heart rate in healthy volunteers. Xylazine was also studied for use in human beings, but due to hazardous side effects, including hypotension and bradycardia, it was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human use.\nIn the United States, xylazine was approved by the FDA only for veterinary use as a sedative, analgesic, and muscle relaxant in dogs, cats, horses, elk, fallow deer, mule deer, sika deer, and white-tailed deer. The sedative and analgesic effects of xylazine are related to central nervous system depression. Xylazine's muscle relaxant effect inhibits the transmission of neural impulses in the central nervous system.\nIn scientific research using animal experiments, xylazine is a component of the most common anesthetic, ketamine-xylazine (see: Rodent cocktail), to anesthetize rats, mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs.\n\nVeterinary use: Xylazine is widely used in veterinary medicine as a sedative, muscle relaxant, and analgesic. It is frequently used in the treatment of tetanus. It is not used in human medical treatment. Xylazine is similar to drugs such as phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, and clonidine. As an anesthetic, it is typically used in conjunction with ketamine. In animals, xylazine may be administered intramuscularly or intravenously. As a veterinary anesthetic, xylazine is typically only administered once for the intended effect before or during surgical procedures. \u03b12-Adrenergic receptor antagonists such as atipamezole and yohimbine may be used to reverse the effects of xylazine in animals.\n\nSide-effects: Side effects in animals include transient hypertension, hypotension, and respiratory depression. Further, the decrease of tissue sensitivity to insulin leads to xylazine-induced hyperglycemia and a reduction of tissue glucose uptake and utilization. The effects in animals last up to 4 hours.\n\nPharmacokinetics: In dogs, sheep, horses, and cattle, the half-life is very short: only 1.21\u2013\u200a5.97 minutes. Complete elimination of the drug can take up to 23 minutes in sheep and up to 49 minutes in horses. In young rats the half-life is one hour. Xylazine has a large volume of distribution of Vd = 1.9\u200a\u20132.5 for horses, cattle, sheep, and dogs. Though the peak plasma concentrations are reached in 12\u200a\u201314 minutes in all species, the bioavailability varies between species. The half-life depends on the age of the animal, as age is related to prolonged duration of anesthesia and recovery time. Toxicity occurs with repeated administration, given that the metabolic clearance of the drug is usually calculated as 7\u2013\u200a9 times the half-life, which is 4 to 5 days for the clearance of xylazine.\n\nPharmacology: \n\nPharmacodynamics: Xylazine is a potent \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist. When xylazine and other \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonists are administered, they distribute throughout the body within 30 to 40 minutes. Due to xylazine's highly lipophilic nature, it directly stimulates central \u03b12-adrenergic receptors as well as peripheral \u03b1-adrenergic receptors in a variety of tissues. As an agonist, xylazine reduces release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the central nervous system. It does so by mimicking norepinephrine in binding to the pre-synaptic surface autoreceptors, which leads to feedback inhibition of norepinephrine release.\nXylazine also serves as a transport inhibitor by suppressing norepinephrine transport function through competitive inhibition of substrate transport. Accordingly, xylazine significantly increases Km and does not affect Vmax. This likely occurs by direct interaction on an area that overlaps with the antidepressant binding site. For example, xylazine and clonidine suppress uptake of iobenguane (MIBG), a norepinephrine analogue, in neuroblastoma cells. Xylazine's chemical structure closely resembles clonidine.\nIt has also been reported that xylazine activates the \u03ba-opioid receptors, with low potency, which may contribute to its effects.\n\nPharmacokinetics in humans: Xylazine is absorbed, metabolized, and eliminated rapidly. Xylazine can be inhaled or administered intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or orally either by itself or in conjunction with other anesthetics, such as ketamine, barbiturates, chloral hydrate, and halothane in order to provide reliable anesthesia effects. The most common route of administration is injection.\nXylazine's action can be seen usually 15\u201330 minutes after administration and the sedative effect may continue for 1\u20132 hours and last up to 4 hours. Once xylazine gains access to the vascular system, it is distributed within the blood, allowing xylazine to enter the heart, lungs, liver, and kidney. In non-fatal cases, the blood plasma concentrations range from 0.03 to 4.6 mg/L. Xylazine diffuses extensively and penetrates the blood\u2013brain barrier, as might be expected due to the uncharged, lipophilic nature of the compound.\nXylazine is metabolized by the liver's cytochrome P450 enzymes. When it reaches the liver, xylazine is metabolized and proceeds to the kidneys to be excreted in urine. Around 70% of a dose is excreted by urine. Thus, urine can be used in detecting xylazine administration because it contains many metabolites, which are the main targets and products in urine. Within a few hours, xylazine decreases to undetectable levels. Other factors can also significantly impact the pharmacokinetics of xylazine, such as sex, nutrition, environmental conditions, and prior diseases.\n\nRecreational use: In 1979, the first case of xylazine toxicity was reported in a 34-year-old male who had self-medicated for insomnia with an injection of 1g of xylazine.\nXylazine is not regulated as a controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. It is sold online through distributors often without requiring proof of a veterinary license. As a commonly used veterinary medicine xylazine is probably diverted from veterinary sources. The cost to purchase Xylazine from overseas suppliers is around $6\u201320 per kilogram. This low price makes it attractive for dealers looking for a cheap additive that is addictive and not treatable with opiate withdrawal medications. The withdrawal can last for two weeks and has a quicker onset than fentanyl.\nXylazine is most commonly ingested as an additive with fentanyl. Xylazine has also been reported in combination with medetomidine, another potent \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist. It is unknown if drug users are ingesting it knowingly. As of 2024, Seattle police report that some users wrongly believe they are consuming higher-quality fentanyl. Xylazine's street name in Puerto Rico is anestesia de caballo, which translates to \"horse anesthetic\". From 2002 to 2008, its use was associated with a high number of inmate deaths at the Guerrero Correctional Institution in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.\nXylazine's street name in the United States, particularly when it is mixed with fentanyl, is \"tranq\", \"tranq dope\" and \"zombie drug\". \nAs of 2012, xylazine users in Puerto Rico were more likely to be male, under age 30, living in a rural area, and injecting rather than inhaling xylazine. Because xylazine and heroin trigger similar behavioral outcomes, the former is often secretly mixed into illegal doses of heroin. The combination of heroin and xylazine produces a potentially more deadly high than administration of heroin alone. Xylazine is also frequently found in \"speedball\", a mixture of a stimulant drug such as cocaine with a depressant drug such as heroin, morphine and/or fentanyl. As of 2012, causal factors underlying xylazine's increasing popularity were still unknown.\nAs of 2022, more information on the distribution of xylazine in the body, physical symptoms, and factors predictive of chronic use was known: when used, frequency of use depended on social or economic factors, as well as each user's subjective response to the drug's addictive properties. From November 2021 until August 2022, 80% of drug paraphernalia which tested positive for fentanyl at needle exchange programs in Maryland also contained xylazine. As of 2022, xylazine was almost invariably combined with opioids when used recreationally, and the drug produced a characteristic withdrawal syndrome which complicates treatment of addicted users.\nIn April 2023, the Biden administration declared xylazine-laced fentanyl an official emerging drug threat to the nation, the first time such a label has been given. Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), said he was troubled about what he learned \"about the devastating impact of the fentanyl-xylazine combination, which is growing in youth across the nation\". According to Gupta, xylazine is the deadliest drug threat the United States has ever faced. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has seized xylazine and fentanyl mixtures in most states, finding 23% of seized fentanyl powder and 7% of fentanyl pills adulterated with xylazine.\nIn July 2023, the first death following xylazine use outside of North America was reported to have taken place in Solihull, England in May 22. A 43-year-old male was found dead at home with postmortem toxicology detecting heroin, cocaine, fentanyl and xylazine. Xylazine is anticipated to make inroads in the European illicit drug market once the most recent Afghanistan opium poppy harvest has been produced and delivered, the Taliban having banned poppy cultivation in 2023.\nIn April 2024, xylazine was reported to be present in illicit THC e-cigarettes in the UK.\nIn April 2024, Seattle police reported that \"tranq\" was being sold as a standalone narcotic, something they had not seen before. According to Seattle police officials, their patrol officers are now on alert for people collapsing due to tranq consumption. As of May 2024, over 90% of illegally purchased opiates were adulterated with Xylazine in Philadelphia. In Massachusetts, the percentage of samples containing xylazine increased to 42%.\nPolice departments in 45 US states are preparing for wound care, overdose response, and creating educational materials for communities. There are still surveillance blind spots and, according to one police officer conducting educational outreach with first responders, drug-addicted high school students \"[know] more about xylazine than paramedics, nurses, and police officers.\"\n\nSide effects: Xylazine overdose is often fatal in humans. Because it is used as a drug adulterant, the symptoms caused by the drugs accompanying xylazine administration vary between individuals.\nThe most common side-effects in humans associated with xylazine administration include bradycardia, respiratory depression, hypotension, transient hypertension secondary to \u03b11-adrenergic receptor stimulation, and other central and hemodynamic changes. Xylazine significantly decreases heart rate in animals that are not pre-medicated with medications that have anticholinergic effects.\nXylazine administration can lead to diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia. Other possible side-effects are areflexia, asthenia, ataxia, blurred vision, disorientation, dizziness, drowsiness, dysarthria, dysmetria, fainting, hyporeflexia, slurred speech, somnolence, staggering, coma, apnea, shallow breathing, sleepiness, premature ventricular contraction, tachycardia, miosis and dry mouth. Rarely, hypotonia, urinary incontinence, and nonspecific electrocardiographic ST segment changes occur. Following a human overdose, symptoms can last for 8\u201372 hours, varying based on xylazine's combined usage with other drugs.\nChronic intravenous use of xylazine in combination with opioids is reported to be associated with muscle atrophy, physical deterioration, dependence, abscesses, and skin ulceration, sometimes progressing to necrosis with eschar formation, which can be physically debilitating and painful. Hypertension followed by hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory depression lower tissue oxygenation in the skin. Thus, chronic use of xylazine can progress the skin oxygenation deficit, leading to severe skin ulceration. Lower skin oxygenation is associated with impaired healing of wounds and a higher chance of infection. The ulcers may ooze pus and have a characteristic odor. In severe cases, surgical amputations must be performed on the affected extremities.\n\nOverdose: Since xylazine is not an opioid, it cannot be neutralized by naloxone (Narcan). However, experts still recommend administering naloxone during suspected xylazine overdose because the drug is very frequently mixed with opioids like fentanyl.\nHuman tolerance to xylazine varies widely, with toxicity and fatality occurring between doses of 40\u20132,400 mg (0.62\u201337.04 gr). Non-fatal blood or plasma concentration ranges from 0.03 to 4.6 mg/L. In fatalities, the blood concentration of xylazine ranges from trace to 16 mg/L. It is reported that there is no defined safe or fatal concentration of xylazine because of the significant overlap between the non-fatal and postmortem blood concentrations of xylazine.\nAs of 2014, there is no specific antidote to treat humans who overdose on xylazine. Hemodialysis has been suggested as a form of treatment, but is usually unfavorable due to the large volume of distribution of xylazine.\nThere are no standardized screenings to determine if an overdose has occurred. Detection of xylazine in humans involves various screening methods, such as urine screenings, thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS). As of November 2022, detecting xylazine in a drug sample requires spectrophotometry.\nAs of 1998, the \u03b12-adrenergic receptor antagonist atipamezole was used to reverse the effects of xylazine or the related drug dexmedetomidine in veterinary medicine, but this is not an approved medical treatment for humans, despite Phase I clinical trials in 2005.\nAs of 2001, the effects of xylazine in animals were also reversed by the analeptics 4-aminopyridine, doxapram, and caffeine, which are physiological antagonists to central nervous system depressants. Further research is needed to accurately identify chronic xylazine usage and standardize effective treatments. As of 2014, multiple drugs have been used for therapeutic intervention, including lidocaine, naloxone, thiamine, lorazepam, vecuronium, etomidate, propofol, tolazoline, yohimbine, atropine, orciprenaline, metoclopramide, ranitidine, metoprolol, enoxaparin, flucloxacillin, insulin, and irrigation of both eyes with saline.\nThe treatment after a xylazine overdose primarily involves maintaining respiratory function and blood pressure. In cases of intoxication, physicians recommend intravenous fluid infusion, atropine, and hospital observation. Severe cases may require tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, bladder catheterization, electrocardiographic (ECG) and hyperglycemia monitoring. Physicians typically recommend which detoxification treatment should be used to manage possible dysfunction involving highly perfused organs such as the liver and kidneys.\nIn 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert to American healthcare providers on the risks patients face if exposed to xylazine in illicit drugs.\n\nReferences: \n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n pubchem:\nXylazine is a methyl benzene that is 1,3-dimethylbenzene which is substituted by a 5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-thiazin-2-ylnitrilo group at position 2.

It has a role as an emetic, an alpha-adrenergic agonist, a sedative, a muscle relaxant and an analgesic. It is a methylbenzene, a 1,3-thiazine and a secondary amino compound. It is a conjugate base of a xylazine(1+).\nXylazine is a clonidine analog used as a non-opioid tranquilizer in veterinary medicine and as an emetic, especially in cats.

Xylazine is not approved for human use and requires a veterinary licence for its purchase and use. The intentional and unintentional use of xylazine is a cause for concern due to its side effects. The use of xylazine can lead to hypotension and bradycardia, and when combined with central nervous system depressants, such as benzodiazepines or alcohol, it can significantly depress vital functions and increase the risk of overdose and death.

It is the most common drug prescribed to dogs who have coccidiosis.\n\nMechanism: Like other sulfonamides, sulfadimethoxine is a dihydropteroate synthase inhibitor. Bacteria and some protozoa are unable to obtain folic acid from the environment, and must instead synthesize it by converting PABA (para-aminobenzoate) to dihydropteroate using the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase. Sulfonamides act as a competitive inhibitor; being structurally similar to PABA, they are able to bind to the enzyme's active site and prevent the synthesis of folic acid from progressing. Folic acid is necessary for these organisms to produce nucleic acids (i.e. DNA and RNA), which are required for cell division. Thus, it has a microbiostatic effect rather than a microbiocidal one (it prevents pathogen growth rather than killing them), and has the strongest effect in the beginning stages of an infection, when the pathogen is rapidly dividing. Since it is microbiostatic, sulfadimethoxine still requires the animal to still be able to mount an immune response to kill the pathogen.\n\nWith ormetoprim: Sulfadimethoxine can either be given alone (such as under the commercial name Albon) or in combination with ormetoprim to as a \"potentiated sulfonamide\" to increase antimicrobial activity. Ormetoprim is a diaminopyridine, inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase, which is further along the pathway for synthesizing folic acid. Though the optimum ratio of sulfadimethoxine to ormetoprim has been found to be 20:1, it is sold pharmaceutically as a 5:1 mixture.\n\nPharmacokinetics: Sulfadimethoxine, like all sulfonamides, diffuses easily when it is in its unionized, lipid-soluble form, and easily reaches many tissues. The relative amounts are determined by both its pKa and by the pH of each tissue. Therefore, levels tend to be higher in less acidic tissue and body fluids or in diseased tissues having high concentrations of leucocytes. Its ability to bind to plasma proteins is very high, leading sulfadimethoxine to maintain higher blood levels than most other long-acting sulfonamides. Comparatively low doses can give rapid and sustained therapeutic blood levels. Most animals for which sulfadimethoxine is marketed acetylate sulfadimethoxine in the liver to form acetylsulfadimethoxine, which is secreted in the bile. Dogs are the exception \u2013 since they are unable acetylate sulfonamides, they excrete sulfadimethoxine mostly unchanged in the urine (their inability to transform sulfadimethoxine also makes them more susceptible to negative side effects).\nSulfadimethoxine has a relatively high solubility at the pH normally occurring in the kidneys, and is easily reabsorbed into the renal tubules, adding to its long half-life. The use of sulfadimethoxine raises concerns that it will precipitate in the kidneys, leading to crystalluria. Though crystallization is not actually a common occurrence in veterinary medicine, it can be avoided entirely by adding a diaminopyrimidine such as ormetoprim. Having the animal stay well-hydrated also is advised.\n\nUse & Dosage: Sulfadimethoxine is the only FDA-approved drug for treating intestinal coccidioisis in cats and dogs. It is also used for:\n\nTreating skin and soft-tissue infections in dogs caused by Staphylococcus aureus or E. coli\nTreating cattle for bovine respiratory disease complex (\"shipping fever complex\"), necrotic pododermatitis (foot rot), pneumonia when caused by Pasteurella, and calf diphtheria caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum\nWhen combined with ormetoprim:\nTreating soft tissue infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and intestinal coccidia infections in dogs\nPrevention of fowl cholera and coccidioisis by Eimeria in poultry\nTreating salmon and trout for furunculosis\nIt is also one of the only sulfonamides allowed for treating lactating dairy cattle (the others being sulfabromethazine and sulfathoxypyridazine). The proper dosage of sulfadimethoxine depends on the animal species, the medical condition being treated, and the specific formulation of the medication. Using a tool like Sulfadimethoxine dosage calculator is important to determine the right dosage based on the animal's weight and species.\n\nNotes: \nThis article incorporates text from the United States National Library of Medicine (ALBON sulfadimethoxine suspension), which is in the public domain.\n\n\n pubchem:\nSulfadimethoxine is a sulfonamide consisting of pyrimidine having methoxy substituents at the 2- and 6-positions and a 4-aminobenzenesulfonamido group at the 4-position. It has a role as an antiinfective agent, an antimicrobial agent, a xenobiotic, an environmental contaminant and a drug allergen. It is a member of pyrimidines, a sulfonamide, a substituted aniline, an aromatic ether and a sulfonamide antibiotic. It is functionally related to a sulfanilamide.\nSulfadimethoxine is a sulfonamide antibiotic. Sulfadimethoxine is used to treat many infections, including treatment of respiratory, urinary tract, enteric, and soft tissue infections. It is most frequently used in veterinary medicine, although it is approved in some countries for use in humans. Sulfadimethoxine inhibits bacterial synthesis of folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) from para-aminobenzoic acid. Sulfadimethoxine is approved in Russia for use in humans, including children, and has been successfully used there for more than 35 years. It is widely available in Russia as an over-the-counter drug manufactured by a number of Russian pharmaceutical companies.  In the US, sulfadimethoxine is one of the products that have been withdrawn or removed from the market after being found to be unsafe or not effective.\nSulfadimethoxine has been reported in Brassica napus with data available.\nSulfadimethoxine is a long-acting sulfonamide antibiotic used in veterinary medicine. Sulfadimethoxine inhibits bacterial synthesis of folic acid by competing with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) for the binding site on dihydropteroate synthase.\nSULFADIMETHOXINE is a small molecule drug with a maximum clinical trial phase of IV and is indicated for bacterial disease.
